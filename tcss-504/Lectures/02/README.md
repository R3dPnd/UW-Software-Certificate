Yeah, I really do appreciate you guys being here, you know, I want things to be interactive. Don't want to force you to talk and participate. But I just, I feel like it makes the educational experience more positive. So
you know, like we did last Saturday. You know, it's okay for you to to unmute. I'm pretty casual. If you have a question or just drop something in the chat, I try and keep up with it. Sometimes I get lost in my own stuff, and it'll take a minute for me to see you drop something in the chat. So it's always okay to say, Hey, Tom, there's something in the chat.
So anyways, yeah, good Saturday afternoon. Let's get down to business. I'm gonna do a screen share.
and
we do have an agenda which I posted under Module 2, and so real quickly, a reminder that I am not going to be able to do a synchronous lecture next Saturday, Thursday. I'm traveling down to Austin, Texas, for a little conference
and and the conference is on of all things, entrepreneurial mindset and leadership. And so it's it's strategies for bringing entrepreneurialism into the classroom.
And so I actually went to a little workshop yesterday on the Uw Tacoma campus, and 2 of the people that did that are going to be down in Austin. And so it's really interesting and good stuff, and I know that it will enhance the way that I deliver my material. And and you guys will see some of that.
You know, during the course of this quarter. So so anyways, I I won't be able to deliver a synchronous lecture. But what I will do is so so Monday is. Is Martin Luther King Holiday. So normally I would teach my my undergraduate courses, but I don't have to do that, so that so I know I'm going to do a recording or 2 probably also Tuesday.
so I will get you necessary material. And I actually put it down at the bottom of the agenda here. I'm going to go over in a recording the course project choices that you're going to have. So I'll go over the details, and then I'll also do a demonstration of each one of them, and the demonstrations are from students who have worked on those in the past.
So so that's interesting to look at the other thing that I'm gonna do trying to get us ready to get into project mode, and I want to talk about team teams and team formation stuff here in just a minute. But the tool that we're gonna use
to manage our projects is called Utrac, and it's built by Intellij who does piecharm and a lot of other pretty amazing tools. So I'll have a recording that shows how to use utrack for project planning and then also tracking your time.
I think I think I said last Saturday, that there's an expectation for you guys, you know, once we're in Project mode to try and put in 6 HA week
on your project.
And so
you know, understanding that some weeks you might be busy. And you know I give you an opportunity to make up those hours, and so we'll talk a little bit more about that later. Once we once we get into project mode. But you know, I I really would like to get us into project mode in our 4th week. So so this is technically the beginning of the second week for us.
3rd week. I'll have to give you some recorded lecture material like I said, so I'll do what I can to give you some basic background, so that that 4th Saturday that we meet in person, I'll go over things, and then you'll then you'll start into project mode and so working with your team members, and I'll have some some work that you'll need to do as as part of that to ramp up for your project, and then, of course, I'll get to that stuff for you guys
soon enough.
So
so yeah, just a quick reminder that that I am not going to be able to deliver synchronous lecture next Saturday. Apologize for it. But but I will like, I said, make sure you're taken care of with material. So the other thing that I wanted to bring up before I get too far into the agenda and then just dive into our topics, for today is is just stop and see if you guys, you know from from last week's lecture. And then what went on this week?
You guys have worked on your minesweeper got that done, and we'll talk about that. But any questions or clarifications about anything that's going on.
Happy to clarify do a better job of clarifying anybody.
Okay?
And so always, okay, to
always. Okay to you know, email, me offline, or whatever. If if there's some one on one that you want to do happy to do that with you as well. And so I see in the chat. James says that that he's good. So, okay.
so yeah, the minesweeper. I I just threw that out there for you and you know, introduced you.
To, you know, reading from file for input and and writing to a file for output previously in 502 anyways. You know you, you probably got input from the keyboard. You look maybe a little bit at I call it tk, enter so tk's toolkit
but but the little gui toolkit that python has. It has a bigger toolkit called pygame, that that some of you may know about or might fiddle around with for your for your course project.
But yeah, I wanted to get you introduced to grabbing input from a file and and sending an output to a file. I think we talked a little bit about it last week.
In terms of software in general. Yeah, it depends on the software. But in general, more often than not, if your software needs some input.
It's probably coming from a file. You know, and and same thing from an output standpoint. A lot of times we'll write information to a file. And then, you know, when you have a need to organize the the data in the file more specifically. Well, then, the data lives in the database. That's truly the most common place for data for software.
our databases. And so as part of our part of our material, this quarter. I'm going to introduce you to a little database engine called sqlite python, and then pycharm the ide that we use from jetbrains does a really nice job of making it easy for us
to work with this sqlite database engine, and we'll learn to write a little bit of SQL. Code SQL. Standing for structured query language. Some people say, SQL, I tend to say SQL, you know, data data, whatever. It's 1 of those kinds of things I do know. Looking from looking at the team information you posted. Some of you have some background with SQL. Already. My assumption is you've never seen it at all.
And so I just want to give you a teensy introduction to it this quarter, because what that'll do
is set the stage for you guys in 506, the capstone course where you most definitely will work with the database, and I don't know that it'll necessarily be sqlite, but it'll it'll probably be a SQL database of some form. The database engine you use. It might be Mysql you know, could be something else. There typically is some flexibility with with what you choose to use.
I do also know. I can't remember if I brought this up last Saturday, so I'll bring it up just in case the the 505 course that you'll take spring quarter as well. The systems programming course that Robert Robert cordingly is going to teach that for you. There's a little module in there that actually teaches you some basic SQL, so those of you that have some background.
You know what's introduced is some more complex queries than we'll worry about here in 504. We keep things crazy simple here in 504. But multi table queries, and, you know, join operations and natural joins. You'll get some practice with that in 505, even though that's database stuff. It's not. It's not systems programming. But but we felt a need.
We as kind of me from when I used to teach the 505 that we needed more database here in the graduate certificate program. So so I put a little module in there. So so you'll get some more exposure. Okay? Because because that is some background that you want to have once you complete this certificate.
So the other thing that I wanted to bring up speaking of the certificate was.
we had a information session this past Thursday on the Uw. Tacoma campus, and
as a co-chair I attended the graduate program information session and 2 of the students that attended and helped out were former students in this graduate certificate program. Last year they both used the certificate
to gain entrance into the graduate program at Uw Tacoma. So I was really happy to see them and chat with them. And you know they're asking me, well, how does the new cohort look, and I said, Well, I've only had one Saturday with them, but but so far so good.
and so I'll probably at some point this quarter. Bring one or 2 of them just on board one of the day for one of our lecture days to talk to you a little bit about their experiences, especially, you know, finishing up. And then what they did to prepare, either, for you know, a master's program, a graduate program.
and or industry. So we'll we'll get you some information from people that have recently
gone through and and have done what you are now doing. So so yeah.
and so. So yeah, there's that piece. And and so the next thing I have here just wanted to talk a little bit about the minesweeper. So yeah, did the file. I/O thing like I just mentioned, you guys did a good job of getting through it. There were a few details, a few I don't know if it was slip ups, or whatever. I nickeled and dimed a few of you on the on the scoring
but but the thing that I do, especially here in the graduate certificate is I give you an opportunity to fix things, you know, just assuming. Oh, maybe you just missed that as long as it wasn't anything, Major, so you know, one of the things I asked for was to to put, you know, comment with Doc Strings.
you know. Just describe the basics of what you were doing. I didn't mandate a modular design or anything, but I did ask for Doc Strings, and so, if you didn't have any comments or documentation whatsoever I'm like, hey, you need to put a little bit in there, please, and so you can go back and do it, and I'll give you your points back full credit. So so you just got to go back and fix it. So there were a few of you in terms of deliverables were just a little bit off.
Nothing nothing horrible. But but if you're anything like me you'll see that, and it's like, wait a minute. What I thought I got everything correct so well, like I said, you have a chance to make it all correct. Do make sure you look at the comments that I provided. But what I can honestly say
is that the guy looked through all your guys solutions, you know, and they're good solutions. I was pleased to see how you you figured things out. Read all your comments, and you're reading these. You know, and some of you talking about, hey? This isn't necessarily the cleanest or most efficient. But I but I wasn't asking for that. It's like, solve the problem.
It was just like, I said, a little warm up
to get you back into code after break. And and yes, I mean, there is that component that you know I wanted you to do it by yourself, or as much as you can by yourself, because you're going to be working on a project with others, and you need to be able to contribute in a meaningful fashion, and it'll continue to build your skill set so that you can move on in the program and ultimately be
industry ready and or and or graduate program ready, you know, or just depending on what you want to do with it.
You know, I I can say, having been involved with this program since it started that there are some students that have gone all the way through the program, but but just
didn't or weren't able to to really
do things as independently as they needed to. And so then, once they got especially into the 506 course, which is pretty challenging. It was pretty difficult. And you know there were. There's a over the years. There's been a few students that
they got through the program. But in terms of interviewing and skills and stuff being ready for for a graduate program, they didn't get to where they need to be. So part of my job to try and get you there, and that's why I had you do the little minesweeper thing and said, Hey, try and do this by yourself.
So anyways, so yeah, you guys came up with, you know, with good solutions.
there's a lot of ways
to go about it. And so the quick solution that that I have not. It wasn't on purpose. I didn't do it modularly. I just I just coded it up
and so
you know. Just just some, some nested loops right? But what I did, and so many of you did very similar things. you know, open up the the file that I was gonna write to and then read from
and then for my field number that I needed to print out, you know, start at one.
Read the 1st line which I know is going to have the rows and columns. And you know, as it comes in as input from read line that read, line method or function brings back the entire line so, and it brings it back as a string. The other thing to note, though, is that the line that it brings that back can have that new line character, the backslash? N, so that's something depending on what you're trying to do, you might need to strip it or get rid of it.
Cause cause it could cause potentially cause some mischief. So
so yeah, read the input, split it into row and column. Cast those to integers. Then what I did right away is, well, I know I'm going to write that to the output file
and then it was a matter of there was multiple ways to go about this. And and that's the thing. You guys what I'm showing you here. Please don't take this to mean
that you had to do it this way. I just want you to have a different look. You're certainly going to get different looks because you're taking for your 1st team based assignment. You're gonna look at one another's solutions to this and then come up with the team solution. So I'll talk more about that in just a bit. But, you know, set up, set up my list.
and then I don't know if you've guys seen the for loop syntax where you just want the for loop to step a certain number of times. And so this underscore is kind of a default little variable that's used. You use it when you typically don't care to look at the actual counter value.
You know, you could say I or J, or well, I guess not, because I use them down here. But but it's just a quick and dirty way to step through in in a
certain number of well, integer values right from 0 to one less than the value that's specified here. So this is an N. The loop will execute N. Times. So this is just reading in the minefield the stars and the dots right, and so then let's walk through that minefield. And so a nested for loop or while loop. Sorry to walk through the rows and columns, and of course, if we saw a mine, we're just going to write that to the output file.
Otherwise we've got to check those 8 surrounding areas and so different ways to do this. Certainly last Saturday I showed you how you could put a buffer around your 2D list or 2D array if you wanted to to avoid these bounds checks right here where you're making sure. For example, the column index or the row index doesn't go outside the range
so you could avoid that. If you put a buffer around it. But and and I think a couple of you tried that. But you didn't have to.
So anyways check the 8 surrounding locations where you're able to, right where you don't go out of the bounds. And then, if you see a mine.
we just add to the count, and then we need to write that count out. But since the write function wants a string, we have to cast it to a string.
Count is the number of of minds we've seen for the current Ij location the current cell. So we need to reset that in preparation for the next time through the loop, the j plus equals. One. A better name I could have used probably was was call column, or something, you know.
Instead of j and then the I, maybe a better name would be row, or or at least an r
but but that's pretty much it right, and write a new line. After we've printed out or gone through all the
current row, and then this line here is the blank line between the minefields, and then and then in the preparation. To to read the next and process the next minefield. That's the read line
which will then get evaluated right here so kind of hard because I had to scroll down. But
but this indent line 64 right matches up with line 17. So
some of you you just really beautiful code. You had nice modular solutions. You didn't have to do that. But you did so. And so, yeah, I was very impressed overall with what I saw, and certainly, if you have any questions or concerns with regards to what I had to say, or any of that, please reach out. I'm happy to work with you, clarify and get you where you need to be. So
so yes, very nice job. I was. I was pleased. So okay, and so.

I have one real, quick kind of random question. I was thinking about.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
00:19:08
Okay. Sure.
Sean Warlick
Sean Warlick
00:19:09
Python has the the context manager, which is great for opening stuff, and if things fails, it closes, it does that exist in other languages.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
00:19:18
So not not a yes and no
So so let me give you an example. In
in Java. So Java is the core language for for our program at Uw Tacoma, it's the core language for for a lot of computer science programs throughout the world.
Usually your your core language is, if it's not Java, it's probably c plus plus.
although Python continues to grow in popularity. So so anyways with Java.
it has some constructs whereby when you when you open a file, if you if you do it. So so you guys know about the basic exception handling where you can raise an exception, and then and then you can handle the exception in Python. So so Java has something like that a try and a catch.
and so you can do what's called a try with resources where you open up a file. And what it'll do is once you're done working with the file. Basically when you finish the block of code that's working with the file, it will automatically put it, put it away. It'll automatically close it. So it does that that cleanup stuff for you? And so
Microsoft's version of Java, known as C. Sharp Ornet, I mean.net is is more than just C sharp, but it has a similar construct similar to Java. And so, yeah, there's there are other things out there with our, with our modern languages. That will do that cleanup for you? So so that's a good question.
John. They're out there.
and we do we like any anything that that we can do that's automated for us. To give us one less thing to worry about, you know, is very much a positive thing. So
anyways, so hopefully. You saw I did the team assignments. And I waited really until just before class today to to see if there was any feedback or concerns with the, with the Me assigning the team members that I did. You know, I will say for one of the teams, just because of how the numbers worked out.
There is a team of 2, the team of 2 that I put together. I did look through what you had listed in terms of your skills.
from from that little team information assignment that you did. And so I really do try to put together teams for for those of you that didn't self form.
I try to put together teams with some complementary skills and and put put some teams together where there's someone that that's maybe has the ability to mentor the other team members help them a little bit if they need to. So
yeah, it's, you know, it's it's an imperfect process. But I do my best, and certainly you'll do your best, and and I just encourage you to if you have any any concerns with that do reach out to me sooner as opposed to later. Cause. It's easier if if we need to move people around a little bit to to start off. It's easier to do it.
Now, as opposed to. Once we get into project Mode and and get further down the road with things so and so let's look at the the specs
for
the group project or the group assignment. And so it's it's I think it's pretty straightforward. It's not supposed to be a ton of work for you guys. But the idea is is that your team will provide an official team solution for the little minesweeper thing that you just did individually. And so the idea is very much to compare your individual solutions and then produce an official team solution.
I do not care how your team decides to produce your official team solution. And so that's why I say here it can be a combination of the code from individual solutions. It can be a single individual solution. You could build something brand new.
I don't care. Okay. And the fact is, you know, so many of you had really nice solutions, you might look at one another's solutions and just say, Oh, yeah, we like so and so's. And so, you know, maybe a tweak it a teeny, tiny bit, or maybe you just don't need to do too much, all right. But but there is a little bit that you are going to have to do, and that's under the additional details. So
so produce, I want you to produce a modular solution that's easily testable. So let me go back to the, to the solution I just showed you right here. This is not modular. This is not easily testable.
all right. And so what you need to consider. And so so this is to get you guys ready for project mode and and for building quote real software, even though we're just. We're going to do. It's kind of a toy project. You'll still work hard. You'll still work, you know. You'll you'll write quite a bit of code overall. But
relative to to software, you would build or write an industry you're gonna work with with something that's fairly small. But it's big enough to where you, you definitely need to consider and think about good design. So
and so. Part of that
good design is that that you want to design things in a modular fashion. So you guys know, from from 501 and hopefully, especially 502, what it means to design things modularly so with regards to a solution, you know, to a program or this minesweeper. What you want, what I want you to think about are
what are the individual things right? That that this little solution needs to do right well. One of them is
certainly your solution needs to be able to read in the information on a single minefield. Right? You need to read in that row and column value, and then the associated stars and dots, and you need to store them in some kind of data structure. Right? So to me, that's an individual task, all right. And so you want to make that testable. So how do you make it testable? You put it in its own function.
maybe, and some of you already did this see? And that's why I said, some of you your solutions. You can just say, Hey, you know what this is ready to go. This is going to be easy to write tests for so
and and so you'll have at it.
and so to me, it's probably really good to have a function called Read Minefield.
Okay. Now it doesn't have to be exactly that, but it's a pretty good name, and you know what it wants to do is read in that row and column value right, turn them into integers set up and then set up. I mean, it basically wants to do it. Wants to read in the row and column. So here on line 16, right. Get those integer values and then set up
and then set up a you know a 2D list, 2D array. However, you want to set things up, but grab those stars and dots all right, and and then, you know, you set that up in your function, and maybe that's what you return from the function.
Okay?
But but that is an individual task. And to me, that's an important thing to test.
Right? So so you. That's that's part of the modularization process. Okay? And so one of the things that are that are often asked, you know, is it? Is it a a student will say, Tom, but my solution, like the one I'm showing you right now, you're like, can't I just run it, you know, and
the fact that I'm sending it this big old input file, and then it produces the correct output. You know, I I did the file compare with the with the you know the official output file, and and you know the tool I use said they were the same. Isn't that good enough? And it's like, well.
yes and no for a for a small program like this you could argue that it's enough. But
I'm asking you to start thinking about bigger picture like on your project and building real software. And so with a larger code base, certainly, you're not going to write all the code right? Especially stuff it all into one place, right? And so think about it. If it's if it's hundreds of lines, thousands of lines of code, or even more, which is very normal. You're not going to wait
to test things until you've got it all done right? You're like, okay, all the codes written. Now let's test the whole thing that just doesn't make sense. You want to test a piece of the time. So that's why I'm asking you to do this for this team based portion. So trying to justify me having you do this work. Maybe it feels but like busy work. But but so I've lived.
I've worked as a consultant for many years. All right. And so writing modular code writing testable code is is one of the fundamental responsibilities we have as a good software developer. We want to write testable code. And so the way we do that is any specific things that our software does. Let's try and put that specific thing in a function or method. Same thing.
you know. And then the other thing is.
we use, you know, from an object oriented standpoint. We use classes to represent ideas. And so back in 502, I think you guys had that little clock shop assignment right where you you had the clock, and then the clock shop and the clock shop was made of a bunch of clocks. So you know, really important that the object oriented
point of view lets us represent a lot of times a concept from the real world, like a clock like a clock shop, and it allows us to encapsulate the information about well, something like a clock or a clock shop. And so then, on a function by function basis, we like to have functions that do specific things. We like to name the functions, to describe what it is that they do that's called intent, revealing code.
And when we do those things, then it becomes much easier to write tests. So it is an expectation, like I said in this day and age that any code you write you're going to have tests to validate that that code does what it's supposed to do.
You know, in python, okay, you guys import all kinds of different modules. Right? And so those modules. That's python code, and certainly you expect that any module that you import has been tested, and then it does what it's supposed to do, you know. And while python is our core language here for the graduate certificate program, it's the same in other languages in Java, in Java you're doing.
You're doing imports as well, and you know, in python using statements. But you're doing imports in Java same thing. You're going to work with other code all the time, and you expect it's tested and does what it's supposed to do. So it really is an expectation. I didn't want to make you do all the unit test stuff for your individual assignment because it was just, hey, show me you can write some basic code here, solve this little problem, you know, and get the right output. That's good enough. So
so anyways,
So you need to come up with a modular solution so testable to me. All right means. Probably you want to have a function called Read Mindfield, or something like that, so that then you can write some tests to make sure. Oh, I can read this minefield.
Okay? And you know, you're you're
your programs reading from a file. So for testing when you write your unit tests. And you guys did that in 5 0, 2, you can. You can put the data to test all the stuff you want in a file.
Okay? Or if you wanted to, it's a test. I don't care. You could hard code it. You could. You could put it in the python code. But you know, for the for testing.
you know, because to me you probably want to test edge cases in terms of your input, you still get to assume that the input is well formed. And so the edge cases are, what's the maximum size, minefield? You need to read in what's the minimum size. So probably you want to have a test. That's 100 by 100. Can I read in 100 by 100 minefield, you know, and the associated sets of stars and dots? And then can I do a 1 by one?
So, and and then usually you sprinkle in a few of of other just general sizes, and then you call it good if all those tests pass. So
so so that's 1 thing that that from a testing standpoint, I think you most definitely want to do the other thing that I think is a specific task. And once again I'll go back to the little solution here. The other thing that's a specific task is producing a hint.
right? Is producing a hint when you know, okay, what I'm looking at is a dot.
I've got to produce a hint, right? Which you know, is going to be an integer value, a digit from 0 through 8, depending on how many stars surround the current location. So so to me.
it's a really good idea to put that code that that produces the hint
in its own function. And and Heaven forbid!
Maybe you write a function called generate hint.
and you know what might you pass to that function? You could pass it the row and column that you're looking at. In this case it's the Inj in my code, along with your list that has that minefield.
You know, you could pass that into the function. And then the function basically does what I have highlighted right here. It checks it, and then it returns an integer value. Right? It's going to be from 0 to 8. That represents the hint. But but that is a specific thing that the program is doing. And so you want to be able to write some tests to make sure that you produce the proper hint. And so it's like, well, geez! What what should we test in terms of hints?
Think about your edge cases? You should do a scenario from a testing standpoint where?
you have. You basically produce a hint with a value of 8. Right? So that means you got a little minefield, and there's a.at some location, and it's surrounded by mines. So that's your maximum case that you need to deal with. The minimum, of course, would be 0. And then you throw in a couple of others. To me. It's it's kind of productive in terms of edge cases to think about. Well.
you know I've got this upper left hand corner, this upper right hand, corner, lower, left hand, lower, right hand, and those are special in the sense that I've got to watch out. I want to make sure that I don't go outside the bounds of my list or array. If you want to call it that right? Make sure that my bounds checking.
you know, like, like, right here, the the J minus one greater than or equal to 0. You need to make sure that that's doing what it's supposed to do. And you're you're not raising an exception because you went outside the bounds. So
so one of the things, and I don't know if if Eric talked to you guys about this in 502. But but one of the things that you really want to do when you write tests for your code? Is you like those tests to pretty much, make every line of code execute so and so there's a term for that that's called code coverage, all right. And and what we want, we'd like to have 100%
code coverage with our tests all right. And and so, you know.
fundamentally, it's like, why wouldn't you do that right? It's like you need to make sure all your code executes and does what it's supposed to do. Sometimes. Some of our code is fairly trivial, you know, from from writing classes you guys know about. Okay, we talked about this last Saturday. Your instance fields right like like for your clock class, that you did way back in 502. You had an hour. You had a minute, and you had a second.
Okay? And so those guys were supposed to be private, right? So underscore underscore hour and underscore underscore minute and so on, and then something wants to access those values from outside the class. Then you provide a getter. If they get to change it, you provide a setter, and of course python allows for properties.
Which? Which we will look at some more. Some of you said, Yeah, you kind of knew you were a little bit rusty. So so I have a couple of examples that I'll get to. I don't know that that I'm worried about that for today, but I definitely will deliver that content in the future.
So so anyways, even trivial things like a get method that's just returning an underlying value.
You actually do want to test it. It might just take one test to just show that it returns a value. I can tell you guys, honestly, I've had times before with a getter, if nothing else. The get method, the getter or function. It just shows you that you assign the value you thought you did in the underlying instance, field. So
and so, yeah, you really want to strive for 100% code coverage. And you know, Ides like like Picharm are really good about monitoring those things for you, and I don't know if Eric talked to you guys about that. But that's something from A, from a lecture content standpoint. I can show you guys some of that if if you'd like me to. You know, it's also it's always easy for me to sit down and do a little recording.
That's maybe 1520 min long. So not too long to watch. And then just post that for you guys to review at your leisure during the week. So
those are things that I'm happy to do for you guys to to just, you know. Get you get you where where you where you want to be where you need to be.
So okay, so back to the specs, and so then the other thing to me
that you want to do the other major thing that you're doing. Well, there's the output component right? And so, you know, recall from the specifications that well, and I'll once again. I'll go back to the code I was just looking at. You know, you need to print
your output needs to be formatted exactly like the official output. So you need to have field and then a space, and then a pound, sign or number sign, or whatever the F needs to be capitalized, and so on, and then a number for whatever field it is, and then a colon right, and then a new line, and then the actual
stars are still the stars, but then the dots are replaced with with your digits, and then there needs to be a blank line between minefields. And so so you want to test for that, too. And so you know, that's 1 of those. Well.
how do I test that? Well, since you're writing your output to a file right? Then you can. You know you you could have a little function right called, write to file
all right. And so if you, if you if you wrote a function called Read Minefield, and then you had another function called Generate Hint, and the generate hint might be called in a loop and a nested while loop, or for loop, or whatever, so that then you populate the minefield and basically replace the dots with
with the the integer values that are the hints. But you but you know you could store that
and then and then you know, if you stored that in a data structure, well, then writing it to a file, you'd have a function called, Write to file where you just pass that 2D list or whatever, and then you write it to the file. Or you know, you could just your function writes to the file with the basic information you have. And so here's where not doing as modular of a solution. It's like, how do I test
that? I got the right output? How can I write a unit test to do that? So that that's where it would be really hard, because because I just slapped everything in Maine.
you know, in the, in, the, or just in its own function, so to speak, it. Just yeah. So so it's not testable. This is bad. So so sometimes you do a little extra work to make sure things are testable. Why? Because tests make sure your code does what it's supposed to do like. I said
you might say, I'll just run the whole program and it works. Tom, why do I need individual tests? Because that's not how you build software. You don't build all the software and then run it and say, Does it work. You test along the way. So you guys get it. You did this in 501, you did this in 502. So so yeah, you probably want a function called, you know, write minefield, and so
that can then write to the file or a file. And then, of course, if you write to the file in your test, you can read from the file you just wrote to and make sure it contains what it's supposed to, and it's formatted, you know, as you expect.
You know, and and all is good.
But but those are the things that I want you to consider. For your team solution to this problem.
And those are the things that at the very least, I think you should have unit tests for.
You know how many tests do you need to do for the right to file? Probably just a couple of them?
you know. And once again, could you do an edge case. If you're if you're reading in a 100 by 100, and you're producing hints for a 100 by 100, why not write the results to a file for that? One more? You know that 100 by 100. And then, you know, see that it's okay.
So.
yeah, you can have tests for other things. But fundamentally, those 3 things that I just mentioned there. You should do
okay. And so something else that I want you to do part of part of what I want to talk about here this afternoon.
oh, yeah, doctoring comments just just like you did on your individual solutions. Use pie charm, please. I am. By the way, I I think I mentioned this last week. I'm your grader. So so so yes,
just do, python pycharm projects.
and that's what you'll turn in, and then I can just open it up in my charm, and life is good. So there's something else I want you to do. Okay, I gave you an official input file, right? To test your program with, and an official output file for you to compare your results against. Okay. But
software developers. Okay, one of the things that we do it's a very normal thing to do is we write code
to generate data
to test our other code. That's a very normal thing to do. And so the fact is, the input that I provided for you guys that that you know, Mindstxt, or whatever it is I called it, for your individual assignment. I did not do that by hand, of course. Okay. What I did originally was I wrote a little program
where I just asked myself, this was just for me, and I said, Okay, how many rows of data do I want? How many columns of data do I want? What percent of mines do I want? And then I just and then my program just wrote it to a file. And then I just kept doing that.
Okay. And so and then I went in and customized it. You know I hand edited it to to test some like
some other specific things that I wanted to look at, that my little program that I wrote wouldn't necessarily do. And so so that's a very normal thing to want to do. You write code, to generate data, to test other code, all right, because it can be a ghastly amount of busy work to try and do it by hand. I mean, imagine trying to do that
the mines dot txt. So let me go. Let me go back to this.
Imagine this, minds dot txt.
Okay, see if how canvas opens it here right? Trying to do all this by hand. Yikes. All right. Craziness.
Alright, you know I I'd rather do a lot of other things
that aren't fun than than trying to manually enter all this stuff. So so certainly, it makes some sense to to want to generate that
with the program. The other good news, when you write code to generate your data is that it tends to not have near as many errors as if you tried to do it by hand. Because us human types. We screw things up a lot, don't we? So it's a really good idea to do this kind of a thing. So and so what I want you to do, you know, even though you had your this mindstxt that I gave you, I want you to go through this process. However.
we, of course, live in the age.
This is the day and age of artificial intelligence.
It's not going away. It's going to permeate our society more and more. And certainly, as software developers, it's a tool that we need to be aware of and know how to use productively because it can make our life a lot better.
There, there are some trade-offs to the ais, you know. One of the things that's currently happened in industry is those ais are able to do a lot of the busy kind of grunt work right? That doesn't require a whole lot of thinking.
that that normally like a an intern would do, or an entry level program programmer might do so. So there's less need for that. Which means well, there's fewer positions at the entry level, you know, right now.
And so industry is adjusting. Education is adjusting everybody's adjusting. And so
and so what I want you to do all right is, I want you to use pick whatever AI, you can do chat, gpt, you can do Google Gemini. Oh, I can't remember the one that Meta has. It doesn't matter to me. Okay, whatever your team wants to do. But but I want you to use the AI to build an input generating program whose output can be used to test your solutions.
And I say, place this in a project of its own. But the fact is, I mean you could you could. You could just drop it if it's just a single python file, which probably it will be. You can just drop it in your official team solution. Just name it, you know, so that I can tell you. Just call it minefield generator, or something like that. This doesn't require unit tests or Doc string comments. You're using the AI to generate it.
Okay? And so the idea is you can use it to generate a test data file like mines dot txt
but but that's the thing is that you could customize it and say, You know what? Let's just run this program once, you know, change the code to say, or you can even ask it. You can even tell it. Let me choose the name of the file, and then you could build these single minefields that are your edge cases, and then you can take those and use those to test.
Write your solution as part of your unit test, like, I'm going to read from this file right here that just has this one minefield.
So and so yeah, it's a really handy thing to be able to do. And so what I wanted to show you is
I went ahead and did this with chat. Gpd, chat sorry chat. Gpd
can't say it. GPT.
Easy for me to say, and so this is what I did. I'm gonna show you all right.
And so, by the way, my, I can't remember if I told you guys last week. But as a grad student my focus area was artificial intelligence. I got my Master's degree way back in 1997. So it's a long time ago, but the same concepts, you know, were around back then. Things have just been refined now, and computing power is much more than it was back then definitely need some new algorithms. But but
so I have a lot of interest in AI, and and you know, kind of like pushing the boundaries of what the AI can do, and you can look over in the left margin. I like asking crazy things. How high could a donkey jump if it were on the moon.
And just seeing you know what it will, the AI say what the AI will say, and I don't want to go look at all the stuff it said there, but but I love pushing the boundaries so you can see here. What I asked Chat gpt to do with regards to the minefield generator. And so you guys have probably worked with some AI before, and the more specific you are right the better job it can, can. It can typically do.
Okay. So of course, the other thing, I not not to go off on too much of a tangent, right? That I do need to bring up is
for the beginning stuff like you did in 502, and some of the 501 stuff the Ais can build that code for you. Okay, they can build the code and do a really good job. And so the temptation is there for you to let the AI do the work, and you turn it in right. Pretty terrible idea.
right when you're learning, because you didn't learn. And you know to me. If you didn't write the code yourself and fight through it and get things wrong.
you might look at something and think you understand it, but it's not the same as battling through yourself. You know the the frustration that sometimes comes with it, the wisdom that you gain from doing things wrong. The other thing is is that these ais you know as much as they've improved. They are still very limited, all right.
They are not sentient all right, they can seem like it, but they are not okay. They're probabilistic.
There's, there's all kinds of things they're doing, but but they're still a ways off.
And so so where our value is going to continue to exist now and in the near future, you know, is using those AI tools. But then, also knowing to look at their result and understanding where they get things wrong because they'll get things wrong. They will confidently give you an answer
right? Because that's how they're programmed, and they're dead wrong. And I'll show you some of that later, I think, in today's lecture. So so I said, Write me a program in Python. That repetitively asks the user for the number of rows and columns for a minefield.
It should ask for the percentage of mines the user would like in the minefield.
It should then write to file the number of rows and columns in the minefield on a single line, with a single space between the number of rows and number of columns. It should then write to the file the actual minefield.
based on the number of rows and columns. A mine should be represented by an asterisk and a safe spot should be represented by a period. Mines and safe spots should be generated, based on the percentage of mines the user chose. After writing the rows and columns and the minefield, the user should be asked if they want to enter data on another minefield.
And so then it said, certainly. And so it generated this program which I grabbed and pulled it into
bye charm.
Okay? And it actually built a nicely modular solution.
Okay, it had a generate minefield. It had a right minefield to file. Okay? And then in here it says, Hey, how many rows do you want? How many columns. What percent of mines do you want? All right? And then it just generated a file name called Minefieldtxt.
And so then it calls the generate minefield function, and then it calls the right to file, and then at the bottom of the loop, it says, Hey, you want more data for another minefield, all right, and then it reads it in, changes it to lowercase in case it was uppercase. And so if it says if it sees
if it wasn't yes. So anything other than why, yes. Then it stops.
And so you know, running this guy?
Okay, so yeah, let me make this a little bigger for you. So enter the number of rows. Okay, maybe I'll say 7. Enter the number of columns. I don't know 4 right percentage of mines. I want 10% mines.
Okay? And then, you know, maybe I decided, that's what I wanted to test. And so do I want another mining field. I could actually type, anything I want, right? Anything other than ye. S, it'll just stop. Okay.
And so
and so, yeah, it just it. Just it just ran for me and you know I can. I can. Look here. In this file that was created. Oh, and the way it's designed the code. I didn't talk about this, but it appends
where's it at when it opens the file?
Yeah, it opens. It appends that A says append all right. And so in case you haven't been exposed to that, the a append means keep the file there. If it already exists, and any new stuff start at the bottom, append to what was already there.
Okay, if there was a W there, then it would wipe out what was there before but the a appends. That's why there was a bunch of stuff. And here's this 7 and 4. And so I said, I wanted 10% mines right? Well, 7 times 4, right should be 28. So you know, it's like, well, shouldn't there be 3 minds? Maybe, but it's 10%. So it's imprecise, right? And we don't really care if it's not depending on the numbers, it's not going to be exact. But
but anyways, this is a great
place to use an AI to generate some simple code like this. Okay, now, when I looked at the code, okay.
you know, it sets up a minefield and then it. And then it does this. You know how many mines. So it takes, whatever the rows are, times columns, and then this, this mine percentage. So, and then it walks through all right. This number of mines that there are, and it generates a random row value, and then a random call value column value all right. And then it says, if what's at that row and column location, if it's not a mine, let's put a mine there.
Okay, so so that's how it solves the problem. It generates a minefield with all dots. That's what's going on online 4, all right. And then it just then it just walks through all right, generating, you know, this random random number generation like I said.
to
to represent them. I that's not how I would do it personally. Okay, but it works. It works good enough. And so this is the important thing is, you can't just take for granted that what it did is correct. You guys know this, you have to look
to to see and understand what it's actually doing. Okay?
So anyways,
So I just mouse on the chat, James foot llamas, I put donkey llamas whatever good good times. So
that's pretty much what I wanted to say. So certainly
these lectures are recorded, and so you guys could go.
you could just go and copy what I did. But I encourage you. Put it in your own words. Okay, and maybe you know, tweak it, or whatever you know, because it is, we have to practice
getting these ais to do what we want, the more vague we are, then they tend to be vague, the more specific we are, then the better they are at giving us what we want. And then, of course, it's always very important for us to test. So use whatever AI you'd like. Have some fun with it.
But but that's another thing, or that's another piece. That that, I want you to deal with.
And so, yeah, so what else do I have already talked about unit tests
and so incorporate results from your input generator. You can do them by hand. But but the idea is, hey, you've got this input generator. So use it.
Try and cover your edge cases, your mins and maxes as well as some general cases. We just talked about this. All right. The input continues to be well formed. Okay, I really like. By the way, how some of you on your ride up mentioned? Well, my solution works. I'm pretty happy with it. But hey, if if the input if you change the format of the input, it's going to break all my stuff. Yeah, it will so good that you recognize that. And and so we still get the data is still well formed.
So
and so something something that I want you to think about is try and do individual test methods for each thing you test. What I like to do when I write my unit tests is I like to name those test functions to describe what I'm testing. And so you know, what I might do is.
you know, I might have you know, in terms of in terms of my testing. I might have
test 100 by 100.
Oh, sorry! Slipped into Java, naming
so so I might have
you know, I might have a test method. And I'm not worried about, you know, annotating it and stuff and making it a test, but naming it that that way all right. Test 100 by 100 all mines. Jeez, I wonder what that method is testing? Right? It's doing a hundred by 100 minefield where everything's a mine.
So you know, you could say 50% mines or something like that. So I've learned over the years, you know, the more intent revealing that we make our code the better naming we do. Then you don't have to go to someone you don't have to put comments in to describe what's going on. It's just kind of nicer, maybe maybe a little bit more typing. But
but it but it's a good way to go. So that's what I'm asking you to do here, you guys.
okay? And so I said, make sure you can read in the rows and the columns and the data for a single minefield produce the hint and then formatting the output properly. All right. Yeah. And name your test method. So they describe what it is you're testing.
Okay? And so finally, I'm pretty much anything that you do that's team based. I always actually just almost anything you turn in. I like a read me.
That just this has got thoughts, insights, or other things. And so in the read, me, put team member names all right once again, just like just like for your your individual you know I wanted an estimate of how time, how much time it took to complete all your deliverables, and then probably there won't be. But if there's any shortcomings, list them. If there are any shortcomings, say, everything works, you know. You know, to specifications as far as we know, and our testing seems to have confirmed it.
And so this is a team based thing. So just a single submission. Certainly choose someone that will get things in on time.
Okay, place all the contents in the Zip file
and call it team. And whatever your team is, team number. And and by the way, I I put in onto canvas just before class today, I put team one team, 2 team, 3 if you want. And and I encourage you to, you know, have a specific team name, email me what your team names are. Put it in the read me here and and I'll change your name to that. Okay? So you know, team awesome team, whatever. So
have fun with that. And so just because there's a lot of stuff going on.
What you'll submit in your Zip file is the readme, your official solution. Don't forget the unit tests. Okay, Picharm project input generator. It can be the same project folder if you want. If you just call it minefield generator. That's fine, or it can be a separate project. I don't care.
Capture. I want something that shows your unit test run and pass.
Okay.
and certainly, if your team, for whatever you know, rusty or not sure about the unit test. From 5 0. 2 reach out to me. Let's do a zoom. I'll sit and walk you through it, but I'm assuming. That's something. You know, we have so many things to talk about here. So that that's 1 of those assumptions I'm making reach out as necessary.
Okay, you'll turn in a file called minesweeper. Input this is a robust input input file that you built using your input generator program, the one the one that you got from the AI.
So it should include as many edge cases as you can think of with the program that I just showed you, you know, built by Chat Gpt. I can do one by. I can do one by one
all mines, you know, one by one no minds. I can do 100 by 100. I can do 100 by one. I can do one by 100 right, and then all mines, no minds, and then some just a bunch of stuff in between.
So so that's what that's what I'm asking you to do. There, you use that use that little AI generated program to your advantage.
Okay, and so yeah, you're welcome to to model the input file. Borrow from minestxt if you want.
And then minesweeper output. That's a capture of the output produced from running your robust input file that you built right here against your team solution.
Okay? So those are the things that I'd like from you, and you know, when you I know I asked for a lot of pieces here, you know this and this and this, but this streams line, it streamlines the grading process for me. So it makes it easy for me. I can look at the code. I can look at your read me, and then I can look at your input and then the output that's produced from running that and and yeah, I get to grade it faster, which means you get results faster. Everybody's happy. So
so anyways, I don't think this will be too painful. Here's the rubric
in terms of the things that I'm holding you accountable for and so if you haven't already make sure you get going on this with your team. Don't think it'll take you too much time.
Many of you already have modular solutions. Maybe your team doesn't have that, so you've got to move things into functions and then write your unit test. Do a little, Doc. String right? Use the AI generator. So so I've got the deadline here. Set to. I think this is Thursday. Let me check the calendar here real quick. That's Thursday. Yeah, it's Thursday which I think is a sufficient amount of time. There's some other stuff that I'm gonna open up for you to work on and get going on and so
you know, from
day, one or whatever last Saturday, you know it's on the syllabus. I you know I use in here my standard late policy that I do for all my classes.
And so
so 10% a day, 2 days late, and after 2 days then then I don't accept it for points. But just talk to me. And so like, if your team, if you find you need another day or 2 on this team based version because you're trying to bring stuff together. Just let me know. I'll give you guys more time.
Okay, anytime you come to me ahead of time. It's like pretty close to 100 that I'm gonna give you the extra time that you need, or or, you know, let you deal with whatever you need to. And you guys are mature. You've got degrees already. So you know, deadlines are important. They're deadline. They're important for many reasons. But I do understand. Life happens. Reach out to me if you're having problems and also team based stuff, let your team members know that you're having issues. So then we'll work with you. We'll we'll do what we can
to help you get through it. But when I play bad cop is when you come to me after the fact, and just like, well, you know I just didn't get to it. Sorry, you know. I'll do better. Okay, so try and keep on top of that. It's it's 1 of those. It's your grade. It's your job to take care of your grade. I'm happy to work with you on it, but you know, make sure you take care of things. So anyways
so I set the the deadline for Thursday before the clock strikes midnight, and like, I said, if you, if you find you need a little more time if
then let me know. But but there's some other stuff I'm gonna have you working on. So you want to get that done and then move on. So it's been my experience that
on this assignment here everybody gets a hundred percent or darn close to it. So
any questions or clarifications on this team solution that you need to produce?
Okay?
So like, I said, so many good solutions by you guys, this is, this will feel it is a little bit busy work. But then you get to know your team members, how their how their coding style is, and and all of that
so so I do want to mention another thing. So when we get into Project Mode and and I already mentioned that I'm gonna do a recording that introduces the projects. I'll do that probably Monday and or Tuesday, and and I'll let you know on an announcement when that stuff is ready for you. And and I'll put those things in the same place that our recordings are. So it'll be under zoom
And then cloud recordings. So there's there's last week's recording right there, so I'll put them there so
anyways,
yeah shouldn't shouldn't be too big of a deal. So let me go back to. We're getting pretty close where we can have a break. But let me see
let me see, what else could I talk about that might be quick
before we go to our break.
Oh, yeah.
So so let's let me show you this and screen share sharing is caring. I know
and sometimes I like to forget to share the screen and start talking about it. So like Tom.
please share the screen. Anyways, what I wanted to show you, my friends, is under module 2.
Okay, which I put there.
Oh, no, it's right. It's a model one still. So we didn't get to this. So I'm going to open up. There's a little brain teaser.
Okay?
So
here's this brain teaser. And this problem has been around, gosh, for a very long time, and it pops up here and there. And so maybe you've seen it before, maybe not
And so yeah, I'll go over the problem. So you've got this spaceship? Okay? Runs off of fusion power. Among other things, it needs exactly 4 gallons of water to be placed in its holding tank. You just crash landed on a planet that has plenty of water, but you only have containers that hold 3 and 5 gallons.
You have to figure out how to get exactly 4 gallons of water into the holding tank.
So then, so what you have to do is you have to determine the necessary combinations
to achieve that, using 3 and 5 gallon using the 3 and 5 gallon containers. Okay, so you have 1, 3 gallon container. You have 1 5 gallon container.
all right.
And so your goal is to get exactly 4 gallons into the holding tank of the spaceship. Okay? And so and so here's the thing. It's an optimization problem. You want to do it in as few steps as possible.
And so the last thing I say here is, every time water moves that counts as a step. So, for example, if you say, fill up the 3 gallon container with water. Okay, that's 1 step.
all right. And then, if you said, pour the 3 gallon container contents into the 5 gallon container water just moved. That's a second step. Okay? So if you pour any water into the holding tank water just moved. So that's a step.
Okay? So so what you can do if you are so motivated is you can come up with a solution to this problem. You start working on it. Now you can work on it over, break. And so what you can do is you can send me an email. And in case you don't remember
off the top of your head, I don't expect you do. I'll put this in the chat.
There's my email <tcapal@uw.edu>. So you come up with the solution to this problem, you know. Step one.
do this step 2, all right, and if you come up with an optimal solution
I will give you 3 extra credit points that'll be added to the assignment portion of your grade.
All right. If you get close, give it a good effort, then I'll give you 2 points, and I don't know if you just
you just email me and say, Hey, Tom.
I'm here. I'm too tired to do this. I'll give you 1 point just for being here. So you know I don't grade on a curve or anything. So you don't have to do this, but it is a chance to get some extra points. So so
so it's a little. Yeah, little brain teaser. I'll field any questions or clarifications that you guys have. Does anybody? This isn't a tricky thing. It's just supposed to be come up with combinations and then optimize it. Try and do it in as few moves as possible.
Yeah, any questions or clarifications.
Okay, so so I'll leave that for you and
and and so we're gonna go to break. And you're like, well, then, I won't get to take a break. So what I'm gonna do is instead of a 10 min break. We'll take 15. So 5 of it. Because I was gonna do maybe breakout rooms. But but you can just work on this on your own. I don't care if you if you're you know, if you're on discord with somebody else in the class, or you want to work with one another. That's okay, too. But I'm not gonna throw you into
breakout rooms or anything for this one. Some other times we'll do that this quarter. But give it a shot. You can get it. You can get up to 3 extra points, and then when you come back when we come back from break
I'm gonna show you
I had Google Gemini. I had Google Gemini try and solve this, and I had some interaction with it, and I want to show you how that went. So my clock says 2, 43. So 15 min from there is going to be 2, 58. So let's take a break.
Okay? So you've got some time to poke at this. If you want, send me an email, Tika <paul@uw.edu> with the steps.
Okay, I'll even tell you 7. You can do it in 7 steps.
Okay, flat out. Gave it away. Just so glad that you guys are here with me this afternoon. All right. So off you go. Have a break. Do your little brain teaser, and then we'll talk about the solution and what the Google Gemini AI said when we get back, so anyways start the recording back up so and so that video.
I'm not gonna play it again. But
yeah, in case you wanted to to play it again yourself.
Figure status update.
Let me drop this in the chat.
Okay.
so yeah, you could. You could watch that share it with your peeps, or or whatever but but pretty interesting stuff. So
yes, they're. They're part of the future, and they continue to improve.
Mostly it's good. But there's concerns. Okay. So
let's move on from the AI stuff.
Okay? And so, too, sadly, well, not sadly. I mean, I'm always happy to talk about it, but some some more mundane things. So we did look at problem solving a little brain teaser we looked at. And you know, how did Gemini do on it?
And so there's there's some other things here so pillars of Oo and solid principles and software lifecycle. So so some very core content for the course that I want to go over well right now. So back from
module one.
Okay.
So pillars of Olo, these aren't too tough for us to talk about, and it's 1 of those
I sure hope you've talked about them at some level in 502, because 502 is object-oriented programming. So and so here's where you know. Help me out a little bit. Have you guys been exposed to? Did you guys and veric talk about abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, the pillars of ol.
did you talk about those or not.
Sean Warlick
Sean Warlick
01:12:24
Yes, no, they were. They were all brought up.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
01:12:27
Okay.
So yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. Okay, good. Thank you. Guys, and so I will. Once again, just making sure you know them you could get asked about them on our 1st quiz. We're still a ways from the 1st quiz.
We'll do a most free quizzes and a lot of times in here. I just do 2. That's good enough
so. But let's review them real quickly. So abstraction probably. Excuse me. The best one to talk about first.st
Everything follows from abstraction.
Now, abstraction doesn't mean
abstract in the sense of like a class, but but what it does mean is a class in general. So yes, the notion we need to represent some kind of entity in our software solution. But we don't want to worry about how the entity works on the inside and how it represents data, you know, to do the things it needs to do.
And yeah, for our intents and purposes, the most fundamental unit of abstraction is a class.
All right. You guys learned about inheritance. You learned about polymorphism, you learned about abstract functions or abstract methods. And so we're not worried about the abstract
class, meaning you could never have an instance of it, because there's not enough information example being like a mammal right mammal. You could have a class mammal, but you'd never have an instance of a mammal. Right? You don't go to the Zoo
to see the mammals
right? You know there are things that fall under the mammal category. They are mammals, you know. Human is a mammal. Canine dog is a mammal, but but we don't have just mammal. You don't go to the Zoo to see the mammals, because they got those little purple, tufty things or something I don't know.
Anyways class is composed of reviewing here attributes which represent the state of a class instance, and then behaviors which represents the things the instance can do
from your background attributes. Those are instance fields, or sometimes called class level fields, and the behaviors are the methods of a class. Java or Java. Java likes to call them methods. Python. They're sometimes called functions function and method being the same thing in our context. Here.
class could be used to represent the notion of what's called an abstract data type.
And so there's those can be even more abstract. And and so there's a notion of an interface which you may have had a little bit of discussion of
python doesn't have
a syntactical feature that's specifically just an interface. Other programming languages like Java and C. Sharp do. An interface is just a very restricted form
of an abstract parent or or base class, if you want to call it that. So, there are some some kind of rules for interfaces. So so we'll worry about that more moving forward or later.
So second, pillar encapsulation oftentimes considered part of abstraction. But but it's important by itself, and that's why we talk about it by itself, says a class should contain
or encapsulate all things necessary to represent and do whatever that class is about
like a student class, will contain all the things necessary attributes and behaviors to properly represent the content or concept of a student.
and no more.
A clock class will have things about a clock. What's the hour is what the minute is what the second is right, and then things that allow us to work with the clock, set the hour set the minute set the second advance the hour, advance the minute, you know. Ask it for the current time. Right. And that's it. Just clock stuff.
So it's like, well, yeah, of course. But that's what encapsulation is. It encapsulates everything about whatever topic it is you're trying to represent whether it's a student or a class, or, you know, a dungeon?
Whatever.
So and so another notion really important is that the data our instance, data should always capital always. So yeah, I guess old school that says I'm screaming it be hidden from the outside world to help maintain valid state for any objects of the class. Okay, we don't ever trust another class to do the right thing with the data of our current class. We never trust that
all right, and it's not a matter of somebody else maliciously trying to do something. It's usually on accident. And I've seen this from the massive code bases that I've worked on in industry. If you don't make something private.
somebody else will try and access it directly, and then they'll put a value in there that's not expected, and then the software fails. It doesn't perform as intended because the state of the object is made invalid. So the data represents the state
right? And so what would be, what would an invalid state be for a student object? A negative. Gpa, okay, grades can be bad, but negative. No, that doesn't make sense like with a clock.
Is there a negative hour for the clock? Is there a negative time, you know, or or what if the hour, instead of being an integer value. You know what if, for some reason, because Python lets you change the type? What if it was a string? You know that said, Hello, there, that doesn't make any sense. So yeah, we want the state of our objects to be valid. And one of the ways that we can try and ensure that our state is valid and stays that way is to not let anything else ever directly access the data.
We hide it from the outside world. And so yeah, one of the things that I will expect from you guys, once you get into project mode because you're going to write a bunch of classes. It'll be an object oriented solution.
all of your instance, fields. Tom wants to see them with double underscores. They are private, they are hidden from the rest of the world.
Okay.
technically, in Python there is a way that you can get into those instance fields, even though there's a double underscore. You have to jump through some hoops. It can be done.
But anyone in the python community, from a development standpoint that sees double underscores knows they're not supposed to directly access that. And typically will honor that.
So
okay, and so I have a side note, you know, making the data private always is a bit extreme. But it should be your point of view, because, like I said, what it is is a defensive programming technique hide the data of a class from the rest of the classes in your software solution. And there tends to be fewer errors because of it. It's it's just tried and true.
And so yeah, the last thing here, when I when I learned about encapsulation as a student way back in goodness, the nineties, my professor, he told me that encapsulation means none of your darn business.
Okay.
I didn't put it here, but he also told us that abstraction means spare me the details.
Okay, spare me the details and none of your darn business. So then, inheritance, it's possible because of the previous 2. And hopefully, you know this, this is review. It allows you to build a new, more specialized version of an existing class. The key thing with inheritance is the child class sometimes called the derived class or subclass is a specialization of that parent class or base class or superclass all those mean the same thing.
Okay? And so inheritance is characterized as an is a relationship, and if you say it out loud and it makes some sense, you might have inheritance. Circle is a shape. Human is a mammal. Okay? But but
shape is a dodecahedron or or shape is a rectangle. Not necessarily. That's that's that's going the wrong way down the 1 1 way street
of inheritance.
But another thing about inheritance that's important to understand is it's what's known as a white box, or sometimes called clear box approach to design.
And so, in order to properly utilize inheritance, you must know about the workings, and maybe even the data of that super or parent or base class
that violates the encapsulation principles we just talked about on the previous slide
encapsulation says you hide all your data and how a class works from the outside world, any other class so necessarily with inheritance a a child class or subclass or
They have to know about the parent class in order to do the right things. It's just the nature of inheritance, but technically it's white box or clear box, which means, you know, something about the other class. It introduces what's called tight coupling, and that's not always desirable. But
the benefits that we get from inheritance because we get to reuse existing code. We get to build other things off of something else that already exists. We get rid of duplicate code. There's there's a lot of benefits to it that make us want to use it and talk about it. But you know I can say this in most of your object oriented solutions. You'll have some inheritance here and there.
but what you do. Far and way more of is composition or aggregation.
which is which is referred to as a has a or uses a relationship. So you guys did the clock shop assignment back in 502? Your clock shop has a or has clocks right? So so that kind of a relationship is far more common in software development and software design in the object oriented world.
then inheritance.
And and we like to use composition because it's black box. You don't need to know about the other class you're working with to work effectively with it.
We'll talk some more about that. Later composition is as a or uses a relationship most of our relationships that we have in an object oriented solution with a bunch of classes.
composition, or aggregation based. And there's a finer point that distinguishes between composition and aggregation. They more or less mean the same thing. When we talk about uml class diagrams, which is going to be very soon, then I'll describe what that's about.
So
And so the thing about inheritance yeah, is, if you're going to override a method, you need to know the specifics of the parent class or base class version of that method to make sure that you don't break contract.
Breaking contract means in the child class that I'm writing. That method needs to behave as expected.
You know, as originally specified in the parent class. So so, as an example, you know, if if we had a shape class which would be a parent class and
we had a we had a method that we wanted to override, called area where we could ask any shape for its area, right? So so a circle, you know, it would provide an implementation for area, which, of course, would be pi r squared.
you know, and square would just be would just be a a side length squared right side length times side length to give us the area of a square and so where you'd break contract is, if for some reason.
when you're doing the area of a circle, you instead, did like 2 pi r, which is circumference. Okay? And so maybe you just got the formula wrong. But that's the idea is like the area should report the area, not something different. If it does, if it does something different, then you're not honoring the contract
so. And you might. You know you're like, why, why wouldn't I do the area? Why wouldn't I honor the contract? Well, exactly. And that's part of why we talk about the pillars is like when we write a child class.
it should behave, you know, based on what the parent class says originally.
So yeah, and finishing up any fields, declared anything other than private and so protected. That's a single underscore in Python that allows other classes to directly access the fields. Is that what you want, especially when programming in the large. And the quick answer is, capital. N, capital. O,
okay.
So last year, when I taught 504, I had an extended, I will say heated discussion
with one of the students in the class, very bright, very capable, complete respect for this person. But but what they said was, Tom, I've been writing code for quite a while. Okay, no, I don't have a computer science degree. But I've been writing code for quite a while, and I've worked in Java. I've worked in Python and Tom. I've made everything public. Everything's been public for all the code I've written. I've never had any problems.
And then, you know, I said, you know there's a time and a place where you can do that, and you're probably fine. But when you're working with a whole bunch of other developers on a very large code base. Think tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of lines of code.
anything you can do all right from a defensive programming standpoint to avoid introducing potential problems.
Well, then, you should do it. And that starts with hiding the data. You just make it private.
Okay, you make it private, and then you move outwards. You go. Who gets to see this data? Does somebody else get to see it? Then you can write a getter.
Does somebody get to change it?
Then you write a setter and set methods setters or your set property.
They always want to make sure that any new value you're going to assign to the underlying data looks okay. Like, if you had a set hour method for your clock, you'd want to make sure the hour was from like 0 to 23. If that's what you're representing. And if it wasn't, you'd raise an exception. So simple things like that. That's defensive programming. And
as you move to industry, part of what I want to do, you saw it in 5 0, 2 with with Eric is I just. I just want to reiterate that it is important, and it does matter.
and it's not hard to do just some busy work, and you do it once, and then it's done and it works.
So okay, so inheritance can be great because you can reuse code.
Okay, but because it's white box. We have to know about the parent class to do things right. We just have to be careful, that's all. We just have to be careful.
So and we'll continue to talk about these things. And so then the last pillar is polymorphism right? And the root, you know, poly. Many and morph means form.
So it's due, possible, or it's possible, due to inheritance. And so what it says is.
we can have any kind of a parent class reference to an underlying child class object, and
you know I could have a shape reference to a circle or a square, or a triangle, and just tell it, hey? You know I could say, tell me what your area is, or draw yourself, and if it's a circle, it'll say my area is, you know, IR squared, and whatever you know, whatever its radius was, it? Give me the value, and if we said, Draw yourself, circle, you know it. Draw a circle, and maybe it's located at somewhere on an Xy coordinate. We don't know but it would do it. So the interesting thing, though, when we talk about polymorphism
with regards to python.
Python's a dynamically typed language. And so it's a little bit kludgy in Python, because you guys already know this in Python. I could have a variable. I could just call it blah, and I could assign it a string, and on the next line of code I could assign it a student object, all right, and on the next line of code that after that I could assign it something else. Right? Python doesn't care.
You assign whatever you want to, a variable.
And so Python has some tools where we can check types and enforce types.
And also, you know, we, we can say specifically, this variable needs to always be this type. It allows us to do what's called strongly typing
when it when it wants to be loosely typed. But
Python will just let you do whatever you want. So yeah, you could. You could just assign anything you wanted. But but the notion of polymorphism is, I can have a reference, a variable.
All right. That's that's a parent type reference like shape. And I can make it refer to any kind of child class object and things just work.
So
and so, yeah, that's what it shows here. We don't do this in in python, you know. But if I had a shape reference it could refer to a circle. Later it could refer to a square, and it just works.
It's always going to work in python. But but this is the idea of polymorphism from a big picture standpoint. Okay, you won't always just use python, you know whether you go to grad school, whether you go to industry. You're going to pick up a bunch of other languages that are, that are what are called strongly typed
and this will very much matter. So it's good for us to know the concept, even though, python, and let us do whatever we want.
So that's the pillars of Oo
maybe boring for you. But just a quick review, so that we're all on the same page.
Anybody questions. Feedback is what it is.
You good with it.
4 pillars.
Okay, you guys are quiet. You're very quiet still there, still awake.
I know it's starting to grind. We're getting later in the day.
Alright, James got me some feedback. It's good.
Sean Warlick
Sean Warlick
01:29:41
Say, a refresher.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
01:29:42
Sure. Sure that's part of my job. It's we're still starting up. Get us on the same page, and then we can really roll
so. Alright, so there's that. And now let me go back to and close that one and
module one.
So there are also these things. This will go pretty fast. You might not have talked about these, the solid principles, the solids.
This is a small set of slides, 2 pages, I think
so. Solid principles. Each letter stands for a thing.
And so the S is for single responsibility.
Okay, yeah. And and I'll read it and we'll break it down. So a class
should do only one thing or set of things, and that is represent what the class is about. Another way is sometimes described as a class should only have one reason to change. The principle is about modular design. It's also about writing what's known as highly cohesive code.
All right. So so what does it mean for for code to be cohesive? Well, a method also called a function in python. It means a method, does one, and only one thing
right? So you know, I just talked about for your team minesweeper solution. You probably want to have a function that's called Read minefield.
Okay? And so the read minefield function. All the code in there should should be focused on
whatever it takes to read in the minefield and nothing else.
If it does that that's highly cohesive.
right? And it's 1 of those you're like. Why would I do other things in a read, mindful method that aren't reading in the minefield. Exactly. That's what good, clean code says, right? And so cohesion is about the focus of your code. How focused is it? And so if we move it to an object-oriented level. A class then highly cohesive class. The methods of a class will work together to represent what the class is about and nothing more.
If you've got a method in a class that doesn't work to represent what that class is about.
Probably it should live somewhere else. Maybe it just wants to be a little utility method or function, you know, and live in some kind of a utility class.
So so that's what single responsibility is. Okay, class just does what it's about and nothing more. A clock class does clock things and nothing more.
And it's just common sense you're like, why would I have a clock do things that aren't clock based?
Exactly. So just ask yourself, if is there code in there that's not doing clock stuff, then get it the heck out of there and figure out where else it needs to live, but not in clock
open, closed, so open, closed. Principle, says a class should be open for extension. So think inheritance, but closed for modification. And so it says. You can add to the behavior of a class
all right, but not by changing the code for that class itself. And so inheritance allows us to do this, and then interfaces, which are a form of inheritance. I already mentioned, python syntactically, doesn't
support an interface. We can fake an interface in in Python by doing you guys learned ABC abstract based class. So we can fake an interface in Python by doing an ABC and abstract based class. And then, basically, you make all the functions or methods of that abstract based class themselves abstract
right. You don't provide an implementation for them. Then you more or less have what's what's traditionally called an interface throughout other object oriented programming languages.
So so the L in solid is Liskov substitution. It's about inheritance. It says you should be able to substitute any child class object
for a parent class, and and then the the child class, or the object that you substituted behaves
as specified by the parent class. So I talked about contract. All right. And so it goes back to what I just said I don't know 5 min ago.
If you have a shape class, and one of the behaviors is, you can ask any shape what its area is. Then you ask a circle for its area. That's what it tells you. Okay, if for some reason it doesn't tell you its area. It doesn't say anything at all, or it reported the perimeter, or who knows what else? Then it doesn't. Then it doesn't follow the Liskov substitution principle.
and we haven't learned about it yet. But I sneak this in when you don't follow the Liskov substitution principle. You have what's called the refused bequest code smell. So we'll talk about code smells in a couple weeks.
And so this principle just make sure you're using inheritance properly. You don't in a child class ever say, oh, this, this function, these functions right here in the parent class, these 2. I don't care about them in this child class. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to override them. So they do nothing at all.
Okay, that violates Liskov substitution, you know, in a case like that. If you think I don't care about this function or this function, I want to turn them off. Then you shouldn't use inheritance. You should instead use composition. So we'll talk more about that later
interface segregation once again. Python doesn't formally support an interface, but it just says, instead of one big interface with lots, lots of possibly unrelated behaviors.
Break it down into smaller interfaces where the behaviors go together. And I'll just remind you, in case you're still not comfortable with that behavior word. Whenever you see behavior, think, function or method. That's that's what it is, you know, code wise
in the object-oriented world.
Right? And so then the final letter in solid d is dependency, inversion.
right? And it says this, instead of having a whole bunch of classes that are related in some way think common code
all right. And then you have this client class that that refers to all of these different classes, find the commonalities in those classes and push them up into a super type and then have the client class work through the super type.
Okay? So that gets rid of duplicate code
all right, and it cleans up your code base all right, and it provides more flexibility. And so a good example of this is, what if we were writing a drawing program. Okay, we're writing a drawing program. And in the drawing program we've got a circle class and a square class and a rectangle class, and some others. Okay? And so, and then we have this other class called drawing program. And so it just has a list full of all these different circle and square and triangle all right.
And and then you know what happens later on, when we add more shapes.
Well, then, we have to change our code base, and the client has to know about the new shapes. But if instead we go, wait a minute. All these things have something. All these classes have something in common. They're all shapes.
They all have a. They all have a
a perimeter, or maybe an area behavior or method perimeter method. Maybe they have a draw method or draw behavior, you can ask them all to draw themselves. So you have some duplicate code, and so let's push that up into
a parent class, a super type. And then the client just works through the parent class. And so we we just we just have a list of shapes instead of trying to have a list of
circle, and square and triangle and rectangle once again, python being a dynamic language, it would allow us to put together a list
circles and squares and triangles and rectangles, and I wouldn't care.
Okay, but but you can end up with a lot of duplicate code, and you can end up with mischief.
So dependency inversion basically guides us to get rid of duplicate code, put it up into a into a parent class or super class, if you want to call it that, and then just have your client class work through the parent. So it cleans up your code base and it just
it gets rid of duplicate code, and it makes it easier to add new child classes later, and the client doesn't ever have to worry about them and have special code to be concerned with it.
And so yeah, that's what it's about.
it helps you decouple your code because the client okay, then it doesn't need to know about all those
child classes. It just works through the parent.
And so the solid principles work hand in hand with the pillars of O. And and I've been told time and time again by former students. I said, I know about object orientation, you know, object oriented design and programming. And so, oh, my interviewer asked me if I knew about the pillars of O. Or they asked me, do you know about the solid principles? So they're just they just pop up here and there, which is like is why I like to make sure that we know about them. But also
it's important to know about them because they guide us to good object, oriented programming.
So you know, speaking of object oriented programming, some of you have asked me, you're like.
why do we have to learn object-oriented programming, Tom, you know, is it the only way to program? Absolutely not
all right. The thing about object oriented programming is it allows us to do some of the things we just got done talking about. It lets us get rid of duplicate code. It lets us hide data from the outside world. It lets us design things in a very modular fashion. So there's many, many advantages
to using the object oriented paradigm, which is why we teach it, you know, as part of 502, and then also 504. I have. I've worked a lot in industry over the years. And there's times when I've written code that's not object oriented at all. Don't need it. But for larger software, for bigger code bases.
Object, oriented approach is tried and true. It's a really good way to go in so many different scenarios. And
you know, you guys got exposed to a few design patterns last quarter. Little bit of discussion of model view controller, and and maybe observer. Did you guys do? Did you guys do the little cause. I used to have a homework assignment where you do, observer, and it was the Lord of the Rings where there was like the eye of Sauron. Did you guys do that one last quarter I can't remember.
Does that sound familiar? Yeah, yeah, you did it. So
all right. And so yeah, that observer pattern.
And you know whether or not it registered very well in your brain. That's another one we can revisit. It's a super useful pattern. So
anyways, these are the solids.
So I wanted to get through. Those always do those as we start off the quarter here. In 5 0 4. And so what I'm gonna look at having us cause cause I, you know, get you for 13 more minutes I might sneak
5 more minutes after. I know it's getting late in the day for you guys, and you're grinding a little bit. It's hard because the 503 class. I know, that's hard stuff. Okay, 501 challenging 503 really hard, those algorithms and the data structures you're working with.
Those are challenging. So so hang in there. What I want to do to finish up is I want to talk about these things called user stories. And then iteration planning.
This is gonna set the stage for us to ultimately plan the work that you're gonna do. Once you guys get into project mode. Okay.
you're not doing this. By the way, on your minesweeper, your group solution, your team solution from minesweeper. This is when you do your actual project. And remember, I'm going to have some recordings that I'll post next week. That'll introduce you to the 3 different project options that you have.
and then your team can can look at that, think about your skill set and think about which one is most reasonable for you to do. So. So let's look at this user story. Talk about this and iteration planning
alright. And then we'll see where that leaves us here. Time. Wise.
Okay, so so yeah, user stories are the basis for planning iterations. They're sometimes called sprints for most agile methodologies. And so yeah, we'll look at the basics of user stories. And then how we can use them to plan our iterations, also called sprints.
So here's what a user story is on the surface, right? So our 1st bullet here, it's a so it's an informal natural language description of one or more features of your software system.
It's often written from the perspective big surprise of an end user or user of a system.
Okay?
So so they're often recorded. Or they used to be recorded on index cards. So I kid you, not you guys.
when I 1st started working as a developer in industry. So this is like 1999, I got my master's degree in 97, and I actually started teaching
but but
we used to use. So so I went to this place. And they're like we're doing agile. And we put our work that we need to do these user stories on 3 by 5 index cards. Okay? And then they had a little like cloth
board, and they they'd have little pins.
and they would PIN up the user stories on this board. And so they'd have a little section that said, You know your stories for your current iteration, your current sprint. And then they had this thing called the Icebox, which is, which is the stories that you're not working on. They're just sitting there chilling. They're in the icebox. You get them out of the icebox later. So. But they were on 3 by 5 index cards. Another place that I worked at actually used post-it notes.
It's like, Well, why are they so small? User stories are not supposed to be incredibly detailed. Okay, that's not their point.
Okay, there they give you a general idea of some piece of functionality that's necessary for the software. And usually it's from the user standpoint. But it doesn't have to be, and and I'll say real quickly a quick disclaimer for us here in 5 0 4,
you
can write a user story for any kind of work that you need to do on your project. It doesn't need to be user centric in any way, shape or form. So as an example.
you're going to be required to work with the sqlite database engine. It doesn't matter which of the 3 projects you choose. And so you could write a user story, and we'll learn how that there's a little template you can follow. But you're like as a developer. I want to use a sqlite database so that I can store the data, you know, or I can store the trivia questions for our trivia maze, or or I can store the file information
from the file system that we're watching, or I can store the information on the monsters for my dungeon adventure. So yeah, I know. I don't know if you guys heard but one of your project options is to continue with your dungeon adventure. I have a bunch more pieces that you'll add to it. So you have a chance to revise some things that you had before, or you're like. Nope, I hate that. I don't want to deal with it. So I got a couple of other projects you could choose from. So back to this 3rd bullet.
digitally, this is how we do it now, project management software. And so we're going to use you track, you know, which is by jetbrains who makes Picharm. And so it's free for us to use.
So technically, user stories could be written by more or less anyone for you guys, you're the only ones that are going to write them.
So the principle is written by or for users or customers to influence the functionality of the system being developed in some teams, the product manager or product owner. If you're using the scrum agile methodology which we will talk about later, this quarter. That's who's primarily responsible for formulating user stories in other teams. Anyone can write one.
So. And and you guys on your teams. You'll write the user stories yourself. And I already said, you can pretty much write up anything as a user story. Whether or not it has anything to do with the user.
And so there are some templates that are nice to use because they provide structure
to what you're doing. And so it might seem kind of cheesy, you know. Kind of, really? But they do. They're really helpful. So as a blank, you know I can, and then we can see capability, so that I receive some benefit, and the angle brackets is where we fill in the blank you know, with with with nouns and verbs and
things. So another way to say it is in order to receive a benefit as a whoever I can. And then there's some goal or desire. And there's a 3rd one here. That's super general. So here's some examples. You might have a user story called screening Quiz.
all right. And following the template above on the previous slide. As the Hr. Manager.
I want to create a screening quiz so that I can understand whether I want to send possible recruits to the functional manager. Okay, another user story could be quiz. You could call it quiz, recall. As a manager. I want to browse my existing quizzes. So I can recall that I have in place, or what I have in place, and figure out if I can just use or update an existing quiz for the position I need now.
Okay, and there's another one limited backup or
like for for 2 of the 3 projects. So there's dungeon adventure. And there's trivia maze if you try to. If you do, one of the games. One of the things that your your game needs to be able to do is you need to be able to save the game and load the game. And so you know, that's a user story. You call it save game, you could say as a player, I want to save a game so I can load it later and continue where I left off.
So that's a perfect example of a user story. They're simple and think about 3 by 5 cards. Okay, the reason they're that way is because you don't want too many details right? What happens if it won't fit on a 3 by 5 card, or it's like a lot that tells you the story is too big, and you should almost certainly split it into at least 2, if not more smaller stories and be a little bit more specific.
Okay.
the other thing. I'll bring up what we're gonna find. It is that there's bigger forms of user stories. There's there's there's called their epics. And there's themes. But you have to be careful with those because they're general. I mean, you, could you could write a a user story, or a
or a theme or epic that just says.
as a player, I want a dungeon adventure game so I can play it and avoid doing the work I should get done. I don't know. So anyways, so part of a user story almost always involves what are called acceptance criteria and what we used to do when we had the 3 by 5 cards that we write them on the backside. But now you just include them as part of the software you're doing. So yeah, they're notes about what the story has to do in order for the product owner to accept it as complete.
They define boundaries of your story, and are used to confirm, when a story is completed and working as intended.
In order for a story to be considered, done or complete, all acceptance criteria must be met.
Okay? And so I mentioned this here. They are epics, themes and initiative and epic large stories, or maybe multiple user stories that are very closely related.
Similar to that is an initiative which can be multiple epics. Or since epics can be stories, multiple stories grouped together hierarchically. So whenever we have a hierarchy kind of a tree structure. Right? We could have this story at the top. That's kind of built from 2 other more specific stories which in turn could be built from other more specific stories. So so it very much has a larger feel to it.
And then there's a theme which can be multiple epics or stories. But they're grouped together by well, a common theme or a semantic relationship. So when you put them together, they have a larger meaning in terms of what they can represent.
So so that's the notion of a user story. And so so yeah, what you'll do. And this is what you get or what what you do from a agile standpoint is you sit down with your team members? Really, anybody can write them depending on where you're at. And you just write stories. Okay, you're like, what kinds of things, what kinds of pieces of functionality we need from an end user standpoint. And for you guys, you can just say, what work do we need to do?
Okay? So as an example, one of the things that you're gonna that you're going to need to do is you're going to need to utilize Git and Github and I have some recorded Panopto videos for you guys to watch to help get you up to speed on how git and github work.
And so you could write a user story for you guys that just says, you know, as a developer, I want to set up an account on Github. So my teammates and I can version our code for the project. Okay, so you're going to do a lot of that.
Any kind of work you need to do, you'll just write it up as a story.
Okay? So yeah, you'll write all these stories. And then here comes the next thing. This is the next slide planning your iteration. Another word for iteration that you commonly hear is sprint. They mean the same thing.
And so another thing you'll do with your user stories is you assign them points. Each story is assigned a number of points based on perceived difficulty.
It's an estimate. And I'll tell you guys right now
you're gonna get them wrong, and I don't care.
So you just ask them.
okay, the the more you work on your project, and the more you write stories the better you get at your estimates. It's it's 1 of those it gets better over time. So.
and this is the nice thing about agile methodologies. They don't worry so much about getting things perfect and exact. They're very flexible. I mean, the word agile says, move around right flexible. Can move around, change directions. Okay, all of those things. So you're not worrying so much about being rigid.
If you need your software to be rigid and very carefully designed. That's called plan driven design. And I think I might have said a little bit last week about it follows more of your typical engineering disciplines, like mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, civil engineering, which are steeped in formality. You know you go through and do your designs very carefully do your stress testing all of those different kinds of pieces?
you know, throw math at it and physics at it, you know, depending on what you're doing could be some fluid dynamics. Who knows? So there's a time and a place for that kind of software. That's not what we're worrying about here. This is, you want flexibility. And so that's what agile is. So the scale used for points can be simple. You said 1, 2, or 3.
One means I was pretty easy story, you know, in the context of what you guys are doing because your your sprints or iterations will be one week. You're like, oh, if it's 1 point, you know, we'll get it done in a day or less. 2 points could be a couple of days and 3. It's like, wow! This is pretty big. This might take us.
you know, 3, 4, 5 days, something like that. So so pretty big
and and that could work just fine for you guys for for this class. But it's up to you. I let you choose larger projects. Use larger scales.
But you don't want the scales to be too granular like if you say 1 1 to 10,
not good reason is because you're gonna argue over. Is it a 4? Is it a 5?
No, it's a 3.
You put a bunch of geeks together. You're going to argue. So you want to choose numbers that aren't too granular. So some common ones are like Fibonacci.
okay, or the powers of 2, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and so the larger the number, the more difficult the story or the longer amount of time. It will take stories that are 1 point or a day or less. You can even have 0 point stories that maybe take an hour.
So a really good way, I think, for you guys to go don't have to do it. But if you use powers of 2, what you could do is you could let the numbers represent the number of hours you think you'll need to spend on a given story 1, 2, 4, 8 16. We don't want it to be too granular, and if you're not sure, you just guess. And if you get it wrong, nobody cares. Okay. It's just like the next time you'll get better at making your estimates. So
anyways, I know we're sitting at 4. Let me finish. There's just a few slides left, and then we'll be done.
So
so you assign points to each story. And like I said, for you guys, you know, maybe you say, let's do powers of 2. And if you have a team of 3, Tom's expectations, are you put a minimum of 6 HA week in? Okay? I hope you can do more, but a minimum of 6. And so you might say, Okay.
there's 3 of us on a team, all right. We're supposed to do 6 h, and so our points will represent hours of work. And so you'll say, we'll say we can get 18 points of work done
for this, you know, for this iteration?
And so then you look at your user stories and whatever points you assign. And so this is the selecting part. Okay, how many points do you think we can get that? Oh, 18 points, because our points are ours, and we got to do a minimum of 6 h. Tom wants us to do that. So we'll do that. And so you choose user stories. You guys won't do it in conjunction with the customer. But in, you know, in the in the ideal sense of agile. That's what could happen.
And so you'll prioritize stories based on the requirements and need. Some stories can't be completed until after other ones. Right? You gotta do certain things before you can do others.
And so the story points should add up to the amount of points you think you can complete for the iteration. So you just go through your user stories like, Oh, this one's 3 points. Yeah, we got to do this one all right. This one's 2, all right. We're up to 5, right? You know. We've got 18 available. So let's add it up
right. If you find. Oh, wait a minute. You know we've got these stories left, and it can't add up to 18. It only goes to 17 or 19. Okay.
look at one of your user stories. You made it one. Could you make it 2,
you know, or or or do you want to? Instead, saying, we'll do 18, we'll we'll do 17, or we'll do 19. Okay.
it's just flexible.
Tom doesn't care. Do what you want. Okay, do what you want.
And so subsequent iterations.
Whatever you do for your current iteration, however, many points of work you end up with, you assume. That's how many you can get done for the next iteration. That's what Agile says in general, over time, you can say I want to do an average of my 3 previous iterations. And so the amount of work that you can get done for an iteration is called your velocity. It's basically work done over time. So so it's a vector that's why it's called velocity. So, and the simplest thing is, how many do we do last iteration? Let's assume we can get that much done. This iteration.
Okay, and so yeah, over time. Your estimates will get better.
Okay, as you go. Yeah. As you go through stuff, they'll get better.
You'll you'll be wrong@firstst Nobody cares. So yeah, as you work through your iterations last slide here, you'll discover the need for new user stories.
User stories can be written at any time.
and anyone that sees a need for them. Sometimes user stories are discarded. As you better understand the software you're building, you're like, well, we thought we needed this. But we don't. Okay, whatever this is agile, it's flexible. Allows you to change direction.
Okay, when planning a given iteration. Look at the cool pool of current user stories, add new ones as necessary, and then proceed with planning. The last thing I'll say is, okay. What happens if during an iteration.
Let's suppose you said, oh, we're gonna get 18 points of work done and you get them done.
and you still got 2 days left in your iteration. You do one of 2 things you could say. Oh, well, there's that other story that we wanted to do, but we felt like we couldn't fit it in. Let's grab that. And let's do that one as part of the iteration also. Okay?
Or what you might say instead, is.
our code base is getting pretty messy. Let's use these last 2 days to refactor our code. Let's look for code smells. And then let's change. Refactoring is just changing the structure of your code to enhance the readability, the testability, the maintainability, the reusability.
all of those things. And so you're like, let's spend some time testing and refactoring our code because our code base is getting messy. I would argue that the end of it at the end of every iteration you should leave some time for a little bit of refactoring. Otherwise your code base can get really messy.
So so that, my friends, is the idea behind user stories and assigning them points, and then also planning your your iteration.
And and so yeah, as we
as we finish up, did I put it here?
I guess I didn't. And and anyways, we're already running a little bit over. So I'm going to stop. There's this thing called planning poker, where you literally sit with cards that have numbers, for how many points for a story? And each person like puts a card on the table, face down?
You know, with with what they think how many points the story could be, and the reason you do that and do it face down, you probably know.
cause when somebody blurts out. Oh, I think this is 5,
all right. They've just biased everyone. They've completely biased the process. So planning poker is, everybody's quiet. You put a card down face down.
and then you turn them over, and it tends to lead to better estimates overall. You don't have to do that at all, but that's planning poker. There's literally cards you can buy. I've looked it up there on Amazon. It's planning poker cards. So anyways, so as always, we've got lots of information.
And so from our agenda.
The the stuff that was listed on the agenda, we did a pretty good job of getting through most stuff, but that'll carry over until next time.
Look for some recordings that introduce you to Utrac to the projects I'll make those on Monday and Tuesday post an announcement about them. We're not going to meet in person next Saturday. There's also some other videos Panopto videos on Git and Github that I'll have you watch, so we won't meet again for 2 weeks, and then we'll pull things together so that you can try and get into project mode.
noting that there's still school, you know tools and skills that we'll want to pick up. But I want you to be able to start poking at the project sooner as later, because quarters the quarter system. It's kind of a sprint
so so. But I'll get you where you need to be. Okay.
I am done babbling into any last questions or clarifications about anything that's going on.
Okay. So the the last thing I'll say is office hour. Right after this, I'm actually just gonna close this zoom, and I'm gonna go over to my office hour. Zoom right away. Got some family stuff going on this evening. My my partner is gonna be home in a little while, and then we've got a we're in Kent right now. We're gonna go up to Seattle and and meet some other peeps. So if you need to meet with me. Try and drop by my office hour like right after lecture, so that I can make sure you get taken care of so very.

I have a question quickly, so.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
02:00:53
Yes.
James  Godwin
James  Godwin
02:00:53
For next week. So you're not. It's not gonna be synchronous. Where will we find? Will we have a bunch of links to consume under like for that week or.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
02:01:01
Right. And so you're.
James  Godwin
James  Godwin
02:01:02
And all this stuff.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
02:01:04
Right. I I'm sorry if I didn't make that clear earlier. Thought thought I talked about it, but maybe not I said that that I will post them.
I said, I will post and remember this is all recorded. I will post them the same place that your recordings go, which is under zoom
all right, and then cloud recordings. There's the one from last week. And so the other thing I said I will do is once so this is where they will live, and there'll be one that says you track, and there'll be another one that says, project project introduction, and so I. And the other thing I said, I will do is I will post an announcement.
When those are ready, I'll post an announcement, saying, Hey, here's a here's
This thing right here, and I'll I'll just say on canvas, go to Zoom, go to cloud Recordings to get this
that make some sense.
James  Godwin
James  Godwin

Thank you. Safe travels.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
02:02:10
Yeah, just going up to Seattle from Kansas.
you know, crazy traffic can be. So take care, you guys, and I won't see you for 2 weeks reach out to me as necessary. Yeah. Safe travels down to Texas. I see what you're saying, that deepika and so yep, we're done! Take care! Cheers!
