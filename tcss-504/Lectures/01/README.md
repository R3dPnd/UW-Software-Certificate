# Course into, syllabus, schedule, team info and mine sweeper

Alright, there we go.
So so we should be up and running.
So yeah, welcome to Tcss, 504, you know, software engineering and development.
And I'm Tom. My last name is pronounced Kapal
and I I prefer to just go by, Tom. You can just call me Tom, but
if you, if you feel more comfortable with Mr. Kapal or Professor Kapal that's fine. But I'm I'm I'm not worried about it. Tom's fine. So
anyways, let me right away do a screen share and get us down to business with regards to
what we have going on.
So oh, that's right. I've got to
day.
Alright. So can you guys see, I'm using 2 monitors. And I I just, I just got this new monitor second monitor. Hopefully, it's showing you 5, 0, 4 software engineering and development on canvas. Is that is that what you guys are seeing?
Okay? Thank you.
Okay, so and so, yeah, as you're joining in. I'm Tom. And as we go through these lectures here, this synchronous lecture stuff
you can drop things in the chat. I do my best to monitor it. Sometimes I I get focused on the the topic or the matter at hand, and and it might take me a minute to recognize but it's also okay to do it. Just just do an unmute and say, Hey, Tom? Or something like that. But once again pretty casual. And so
so yeah, we'll do that
let me. I have. I have a little itinerary or an agenda for us
that I'm going to try and bring up here. It is okay.
I did post this under module one of canvas. Oh, I don't know. An hour hour and a half ago. So kind of look at what we're about today. And so yeah, 1st and foremost, a welcome to you.
I know that I remember doing some of our informational sessions over the past year, and did meet some of you so good to good to see some names that I recognize. And so a little bit of background on myself. I mentioned some of it in the the announcement that I that I sent out to you guys last week.
And then there's some stuff that's just on canvas. But so this is my 5th year at University of Washington, Tacoma
I also have.
and before that I taught for goodness 20 plus years on the other side of the State at Eastern Washington University. But I've also consulted, worked in a consulting role so worked in industry for 20 plus years, so teaching and doing some industry stuff.
complimentary things. I used to joke that the money that I made in industry, made up, made up for the money. I don't make teaching, but but I'm I'm fairly compensated. It's I'm not hurting. So
anyways, so I do. I have a lot of experience. And then this course here 504. I built this course when we started the graduate certificate, which was 5 years ago, which is, when I came on board
at University of Washington, Tacoma, and I think I might have mentioned this as well. I also built that 502 course that was delivered by Veric for you guys last quarter most of what you see there content wise the quizzes, the assignments. Most of that stuff was originally built by me. So so, you know, if you were frustrated with that stuff, then now you can let me know.
I also
built the 505 course the the systems programming course that you'll take spring quarter, and Robert Cordingley, who you had for 501 is gonna is gonna teach that 505. So you get to work with him again. And so he does a great job with the 505 hopefully, hopefully, you had a good experience with him in 501 and also with Varek in 502.
So one of the other hats that I wear is, I'm a co-chair for the computer science and Systems program at University of Washington, Tacoma, in the school of engineering and technology. And so one of the things that I get to do in the leadership role that I have is I get to look at course, evaluations. And so, of course, one of the things that I spent time doing over break was looking at your guys's feedback
in the in the 501 and the 502 courses, and so you know, for the for the most part. It seemed like you were pretty happy with the product. But one of the things that I like to say here on day one in 504.
Is that any questions that you might have from the content or the material in either 501 or 502. I'm happy to talk to you about that. You know I do want to do some review as part of this afternoon's lecture, just over some some object-oriented concepts that I hope are you got kicking around in your brain from 502,
you know the 501, the data structures course. You'll certainly employ some of the concepts that you picked up there for some of the things that we do here in 504. But but it's it's not a focus of what we do. We? We really pick up where 502 left off?
5 0, 4, for the most part is a project course.
And so I think you guys saw, and I'll go over this just to make sure we're all on the same page. But, there's a there's a little assignment for you to give me the background information on yourself so that I can form teams. So for your project, this quarter and I do let you self form teams if you want to. We'll talk more about that in just a little bit. But but yeah, you'll you'll work in teams quite a bit, and we do. We pick up where 5 0 2 left off.
And so the the stuff you learned in 501 is mission critical for 503, and you will employ some things like I said, from 501, and then the stuff you'll pick up in 503, perhaps for for the project that you choose to work on here in 504. And you know a lot of preview stuff today, because it's our 1st time meeting. But in the past
I've let in 5 0, 4. I've let the teams choose from from 2 different projects. I'm I'm gonna add a 3rd project this quarter for you guys to to choose from. I'm still finalizing the details on that. And once I have that ready, of course I'll post it along with the other 2 that I that I traditionally allow you to choose from and then we'll go from there. So
so anyways, there's going over the agenda here. So I give you a little bit of background on myself. I I live
well, I guess formally, I I live in Tacoma Central Tacoma. I'm a mile and a half from Uw Tacoma campus was able to do that on purpose. So it's nice, but I I've got a partner, Polly, and and she lives in Kent. And so I actually tend to spend more time in Kent. Probably 5 days a week there and then 2 days a week. Here in Tacoma we we go back and forth a little bit. And so
so that's where I live. And then the other thing, because because I want to kind of go around with everyone's here that's here. And maybe you did this in 503 with my partner in crime, Kevin Anderson. But you know, maybe say, Hey, where do you live? And you know what's your favorite thing to eat or drink, or maybe do as a hobby.
You know something that I've been doing quite a bit of the last year. I mentioned I got a partner, and we work out at planet fitness a lot. So we've gotten much more fit. And it's it's actually something that I look forward to doing so
there's things I certainly like to eat and drink, and so on. But yeah, but working on a planet, fitness to me is actually a very good time. So so yeah, with that, said I would, you know, not to put you guys too much on the spot. But if you wouldn't mind. Just kind of going around.
and just a brief introduction who you are, maybe where you live, and
something fun about you. You know what you like to eat what you like to drink, what you like to do for a hobby, or just something else that's interesting.
Anybody feel free to unmute and just say, Hey.

I'm sorry. What did you ask us about? Like? No like our name, our hobby.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
00:09:23
Just whatever. Yeah, whatever something interesting. It could be something interesting
like to drink, or something you like to do.
James  Godwin
James  Godwin
00:09:30
I love coffee, and I love to hike. But that's true of everyone out here. You mentioned planet fitness. I love. My my cult of choice is orange theory fitness. Otf, working out there with my with a good friend of mine. We go like twice a week, and to your point about like.
you know, the exercise being addicting. And it's like, Wow, that endorphin rush, you know, like healthy body, healthy mind. I feel like the quality of my life is so much better now that I'm actively working out. And there's a sense of community involved with it. And I really appreciate that recommend to everyone.

So yeah.
Sean Warlick
Sean Warlick
00:10:13
Yeah, there we go. I live in North Seattle. We've been here about 10 years now, and I've
so most of that time working as a data scientist at Boeing.
2 small children. I have time for basically one hobby at this point. And that's bikes. You know, bike has been my primary form of transportation for years, and I love working on and rebuilding them, doing my own maintenance. So yeah.
Tom Capaul

Great. Thank you for sharing that. Appreciate it, someone else.
anyone.
And if if for some reason you don't have audio, it's okay to to drop something in the chat. If you want
anybody.
There's something wrong with my machine. Maybe I'm not just tearing anything.
Maddy
Maddy
00:11:24

I have a Bs in chemistry, but
Maddy
Maddy
00:11:41
I'd like to broaden my skill. Set a little because I'm pretty indecisive about what I want to do in the future.
And programming struck my address.
I'm a pretty sedentary person, but when I'm not being sedentary, I really like skiing.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
00:11:57

00:12:12
Of course.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
00:12:12
Okay, yeah. Anybody else. I don't wanna force you guys to do this. But it's just kinda we're gonna be hanging out. You guys are hung out all last quarter you're gonna work on teams and teams here. So it's just an opportunity to to have a little bit of
information exchange. That's, you know, not not, course related. So.

Good afternoon, everyone. Good afternoon, Professor Tom.
So I am.

I am Janine Gd. Mcgorman, concurrently enrolled in the Gcsde. And an Mba program
at different universities. Oh, my, yeah, I have a thesis in progress also. So it's kind of a busy year for me last year, and also busy year, because I'm focused on finishing my books. I hold a Bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Central Mindanao University in the Philippines, where I completed a
brief
programming course 15 years ago. Although although I have no work experience in programming my use of CAD and sold solidworks. Software in manufacturing and design has
sparked my curiosity about the code that powers these applications. So last year I have developed
and interest in artificial intelligence and cyber security which led me to study programming through books and crash courses on Youtube until I found this program, and then my father-in-law, a retired software engineer, has also been, has also been a
great influence in this career transition. He he works.
I formerly works in Us. Air Force. And I consider myself a novice and view my background as a work in progress committed to improving my skills in computer science and software development engineering. And I love reading books.
I love writing and watching my favorite show the Big Bang theory.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
00:14:51
Oh, yeah, that's a good one. I've watched them all more than once.
Jannine G. D. MacGormain
Jannine G. D. MacGormain
00:14:55
Me, too. Thank you.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
00:14:58
Great. Thank you so much for sharing that wonderful, wonderful stuff. Anybody else willing to to say a little couple of things here?
Okay, well, I am. I'm not gonna I'm I'm not like, I said, I'm not gonna force you guys so I'm gonna go ahead and move on.
And you know, maybe another time, once we get a little bit more comfortable, some others can share a little bit. So I'm going to go back. Speaking of sharing. I'm going to go back to the screen share here.
Okay? And so this is our our 1st day. And and so we're officially scheduled for 1, 30 until 4, and what I'll usually do at the the quote halfway point point. So that's that's somewhere between 2, 30 and 3. We'll have a 10 min break just kind of depends on where we're at with content. And you know I'll I'll say right now that
you know I can. I can get in
lecture mode, or whatever. And and just, you know, whatever it is we're talking about, and examples that we're looking at. And so it's always okay for you guys to just either drop in the chat or or just do a quick on mute and say, Hey, Tom, how about that 10 min break? We? We could use it now we're starting to grind a little bit. So it's easier for me because I'm delivering the content, and not the one that has to absorb all the content. So anyways.
because we are just getting started out. It! It might be that I that I try and run until like 4 15 today I don't know that we'll go to 4, 30. But I just I just. There's some things I really like to talk about in our 1st meeting and and get through those things
if possible. So so so I might run a little bit long, just giving you a warning. And the other thing that I'll point out is that these lectures are recorded. They'll be posted on canvas. I think you guys are used to this game, I think, or hopefully, from 501 and 502. But if I
let me go over to canvas. And so just in case? Because because maybe
because maybe Robert and Veric did their recordings a little differently. But on canvas. And you do need to make sure you're logged in with an active session. You can get stale step, stale sessions, and it won't show you everything. But under zoom. If you go to cloud recordings there's nothing here yet, but this is where our recordings from lecture will live.
And so usually I'll get a notification from zoom it seems like it takes about an hour
after lecture completes for me to get an email about that. And and I try and post the the links to those in a timely fashion. So typically you know, later, Saturday afternoon or early Saturday evening, I'll try and get them posted here. And and so the other thing that I'll always do is the topics that we went over the major topics. I will label that as part of what the zoom recording says.
And so I think this is important when you try and review material, and also, if Heaven forbid! You're forced to miss the lecture
which happens. Of course, life happens from a scheduling standpoint. Saturdays can be hard, you know. I found out that that some of you have children, and so, you know, they've got events, you've got things you need to do. And so one of the things that we really try and do with this graduate certificate program. And being an online program is is provide flexibility for you. Because you know, most of you are working, you know, and or have families and or have other things going on so
whatever we can do, and whatever I can do to facilitate that I'm happy to do so so.
But that's where the recordings will live. So the cloud recordings tab
when we're done. So. So yeah, we might run a little bit long. And and speaking of schedules and having to miss things. I have a couple of things going on in my world that are just. They're unavoidable. So I wanna, I'm gonna jump down here to the schedule and just bring this up and so
2 Saturdays from today, I'm going to be at a conference in Austin, Texas. I'm actually flying back Saturday afternoon. I'll be there a couple days before it's about entrepreneurship and basically how to deliver it in the classroom. Something that I could ultimately talk a little bit to you guys about among other courses that I teach
but but I I can't avoid that. And so what that means is, I will have some recorded material for you. So that that 1, 25 day this month
will not be a synchronous lecture. But I will have recordings that I do, and they'll go under the zoom recordings under cloud recordings in that same location.
And you know we'll see where we're at. Content, wise, and then I'll I'll make some recordings. That are, you know, as appropriate.
and I'll I'll post an announcement on canvas, so that you know that they're available for you. But but we will not meet
for synchronous delivery of lecture on the 25, th and so then next month, February. So Saturday, the 20 second, one of the other one of the other hats that I wear. We all wear many hats, and so I'm involved with this. It's called the Puget Sound Programming Contest. And so me and another faculty member at Uw. Tacoma. His name's Chris Marriott. He and I put on this
programming contest, and the winter contest is going to be. We always do it on Saturday. And so it's going to be on the 20 second, and what I'd like to point out, I'll give you some more information here in just a sec. But this is something that if you would like to
you could come and participate in this contest. It's on the Uw Tacoma campus. It's free to compete.
You work in teams of 3, and hopefully you got the announcement that I posted last week, and it said, Hey, there's a little warmup assignment that I want you to try and work through on your own, if possible, just to kind of make sure your skills, at least fundamentally, are in a reasonably good place for you to be successful here in 504 and work in a team environment ultimately. But that problem, this little minesweeper problem. If you've taken a look at it.
That's the kind of problems that you see at the programming contest. Some are easier, some are much harder. But but anyways I am part of this. One of the 2 people that puts it on. And I I was gonna open a tab. But I got so busy I have so many tabs open for you guys today.
Puget sound programming contest. So just just to give you a quick view. And I'll talk to you guys more about this later.
I could heck the the miracle of
of zoom here. I can, just for a sec.
Drop this in the chat just in case you want to go look at it.
but I've got it up. I'll have it up on the screen here.
So anyways,
this contest like I said, it's on the Uwt campus, and there's some information about it. We're in the science building all that kind of stuff. So so you could do this if you want to. Actually, anybody that ever participates in this. It doesn't matter what course it is that I'm teaching. So this will count for you guys as well. I'll give you extra credit for participating in the contest.
So, and and the way I grade stuff, it's not competitive in here. It's just, you know. You earn what you earn so
anyways. Some more details on that later. I suppose another thing that I could to bring up about contests, and this is some of the background about me.
I'm also involved with what's called Icpc, which is the International Collegiate programming contest, and I'm the director for the Pacific Northwest region, so that includes British Columbia, Washington State, Oregon, Central and Northern California, and and actually believe it or not Hawaii. They're in the Pacific northwest region. They didn't have anyone else to join, really, and you know, in terms of time zones.
Well, right now we're just 2 h different from Hawaii. But anyways, so so I've been involved with this contest stuff for a very long time. It's it's something that's a very good experience for students. And so I so I volunteer my time.
I'm actually the deputy director for North America. So I'm second in charge, and I'm also a part of the International steering committee. So so I do a lot of stuff with this contest and and a lot of passion for it, because ultimately it helps students. And so I'll talk to you guys some more about that, you know, once we get into the beginning of February, and you know, if you had some interest in participating in the contest. That that'd be great. And you know.
why would you, wanna, you know.
take some time to participate in one of these contests? Well, because you get to work in a team. It's teams of 3, and you use python. You can use pretty much any programming language you want, and you get to practice problem solving. And you're also writing code under pressure. You know, you're competing. And you might feel like, Well, I don't.
I don't
really like competing. But so if you intend to work in the software industry, there's a reasonable chance that you will
have an interview. You have to do some technical interviews. And so the problems that you see at these contests are
very
similar to the things you might be asked to do at a technical interview. There's some websites out there. One of them is called Leak Code, good to practice up for interviews on the Leak code website. And there's some other sites that are that are like that. So so there is some motivation for doing the contest. And then the other thing is is that
anything that you do. Extracurricular, of course. And you guys all have degrees. So you know the game here. Anything you do extracurricular, it goes on your resume. And you know, a potential employer, you know, with regards to software, anytime, they see someone that's doing extracurricular things things outside the classroom, things that show they have the fire in their belly to either solve problems, build software. You know any of those kinds of things. It's just. It's a very positive
kind of thing to do so.
So those are some motivations for maybe considering to do something along these lines. And so I do realize you're like, Well, wait.
But I've got. You know I've got the the 504 class and the 503 class. Of course you won't have 5 0, 4 lecture wise on the on February the 20 second. But you'll have Kevin's 5 0. 3, but he knows about the contest and you know he he wouldn't have a problem if you if you chose to miss that. So anyways, there, there's a couple of things
for you right there.
So let me go back to. Oh, here it is, right here. Here's the agenda. And so
so yeah, on those days the 25th and the 20. And then February the 20 second we won't have synchronous lecture, but I will have recorded material for you. So I take very serious the money that you guys are paying for this program? I take a lot of pride in in delivering a good product and making sure that you're prepared
for what comes next. And so the 2 what comes next are the capstone course, 506 that you'll take this spring, and then you know whether you decide you want to go to industry or before you go to industry. Maybe you maybe you want to earn a master's of some form in computer science. A lot of students that have gone through the program have done that. Some have done both. So
yeah. So I I do make. I do want to make sure. That that you get the material that you need to to be successful moving forward. So so yeah, we'll watch out for that on the schedule. And of course, I'll post reminders. About those things. So
okay, so let's go take a look at.
think it's I can close the zoom need to close some of my tabs here.
Okay, so the so the syllabus here?
hopefully, you had a time or had some time to look through it, and in terms of of what you need. With regards to, you know, hardware software. Really, whatever you use for 5 0, 2 is fine for what we're gonna do here in 5 0, 4
and so I know that in 503 that that Kevin Anderson he's probably gonna have. You guys work with Jupyter notebook stuff. We we don't do that here in 504. Pycharm is is what I use for the code examples that I show you guys and and I expect that you guys will use pie charm, probably for for your team project, which, like, I said, I'll give you the details of those
soon enough. But there's there's day one things we need to go through first.st So so yeah, you'll you'll work with pi charm that ide maybe expand a little bit on the the things you did in 502. Another thing that I want us to do is
work with code versioning. So git and github it's my expectation that you haven't done those things yet to get. And github stuff.
I have some recordings. They're actually panopto recordings.
That that I'll point out to you. And usually what I do in this class is, here's the recordings and watch them by this this day, right here. And they give you basic background in in what get is and the fundamental commands that are a part of it, and then how to do some basic things on Github. So you'll you'll want to use that
when you get into project mode to build your software, to build your project so that you can
share code with your team and and do it in a safe way. So so we will talk about that more like I said, today's day one. So it's kind of a survey of so much that we're going to be doing
you know, as necessary in Pycharm. We'll spend some time in the debugger. Hopefully. You got at least a little bit familiar with the debugger from from the things that you did in 501 and 502 you know, here in 504.
It's a lot. We still have to learn some syntactical things, and I'll introduce those things to you where I think is necessary. But it's bigger picture. We're thinking about building a piece of software and going through the process of how do we build that software? Starting from scratch? What are our set of considerations? And so one of the things that we'll talk about this afternoon
is the software lifecycle. It's like what happens first, st then what's next? And so on. And intuitively, you'll you'll know some of the steps, and and maybe Varek or Robert talk to you about some of them in 501 or 502. I'm not going to assume that I'll just flat out, tell you so.
You'll you'll do some more documentation things. And in in python, of course, that's through Doc, string
and then so the other thing is, you're going to work on a project, and so you'll need to plan your project. And so the tool that I use. I just started using it last quarter. It's actually built by jetbrains. So who makes piecharm? And it's called you track, and it's quite easy to use, and I will. If I don't demonstrate it as part of lecture, I'll have recordings for you some brand new recordings I'm going to make
to to show the usage of you track. But we will build what are called user stories. So we're gonna learn about what a user story is. And also these things called use cases. Once again, those terms might have come up for you previously, but I don't assume that here, in 504. Another thing that I'll have you do, which is very real world. You know some of you have had to do this kind of thing and and other roles. You've served Job wise. I do. Have you log your hours
on you track. It makes it pretty easy to do so. Because this is for the most part a project course. Your your homework. Once we get into project mode, will be to work on the project, and then I just I want you to put time in, and then you'll log your hours. So it's pretty straightforward. It's pretty simple, and you know I found here in 5 0, 4. Not typically a problem.
In terms of of you guys getting your hours in. I can say that I do understand. Some of you are workers, you know you're working. You're working professionals, and you have other things that pull at your time. And so there might be a week or 2 where you're really busy. And you're like Tom, you know, you have an expectation of us putting in at least, you know, 6 HA week on this project, but I can't always do that.
And so, you know you can. You can reach out to me and your team members, and you know I could excuse it, depending on what what the issue is, but I also allow you to make up the hours on a subsequent iteration or sprint. So once again, this is day one. This is a preview. So we're gonna look at all this stuff again as necessary, moving forward in greater depth and detail.
So something else that we'll talk about. Are uml class diagrams. So there's so Uml is unified modeling language. You know, got put together in the mid nineties because the software community, a bunch of people, were doing the same kind of things, but in different ways. And so they came up with unified modeling language. And so
there's lots of different kinds of Uml, we're just going to worry about class diagrams. You know, there's there's sequence diagrams. There's activity diagrams. There's state diagrams
I have found from from my my time in industry, what I've used the most productively are Uml class diagrams. And so I will introduce that to you. That's part of the lecture content that I deliver, and I'll show you how the tool that I like to use. There's tons of them out there. But there's this drawio, which is a website. The price is right, it's free to use. So
so I'll show you that. And so we'll learn about these uml class diagrams. And what I'll have you do. Speaking of the Uml class diagrams is for your project. You'll do a draft
as you. As you get your project started, you'll you'll think about the classes that you're going to need and certainly I'll provide a little bit of guidance for you, and then that will evolve over time. And then at the end of the quarter, you'll deliver an updated an updated version of your Uml class diagram for your project.
So so those are some things that we'll learn about. And then, yeah, I already mentioned today, we'll talk about the software lifecycle. We'll talk about what are called software design paradigms, right? Paradigm
way of looking at things a point of view. So the the paradigm that will follow. For your project, which is still pretty much the most common way to develop software is is agile. So so we'll learn about what it means to be agile. You know what agile methodologies are, but there are other ways to build software often called. They fall under the category called plan driven design.
You know, I just just found out some of your engineers. So a mechanical engineer could be civil, electrical, and so plan driven. Design has a very strong engineering feel
to it, you know, like mechanical or civil or electrical, where it's a very formal, it's very process based. And so sometimes when you're building software. You want to do it that way, especially when it's mission critical software where you got to get it right the 1st time you don't get a second chance. So we'll learn more about that later.
I mentioned project planning.
And so we'll we'll learn about user stories. And then these other things called use cases which are which are which are kind of a more detailed version of a user story. They are different, but but some similarities. And and so I'll clarify what those are
mentioned versioning with. Get you guys got exposed hopefully. And and I did review the material. The the stuff from 502 that Varick delivered to you. So
you know, you guys learned about observer, I think, and had a little bit of talk about model view Controller, Mvc. I will revisit Mvc. For you guys next Saturday's lecture. That's when I intend to talk about it. But but there's other patterns. There's factory pattern. There's a Singleton pattern. And so these patterns their design expertise. And so when you're building bigger software, so
which is what we think about here in 504. These patterns they can just help with the structure of your software. They help with the design. So
hence design patterns. So so you'll pick up some more patterns. I I've
patterns are one of the things I learned about from industry and using them productively really does help you build better software. You know better in what way? Well.
easier to read.
So so it helps with readability, helps patterns help with testability. They help with reusability. They help with maintainability patterns help with these things called the illities, although not all of them are illities. Some of them can be like security, for example. So so yeah, we'll learn some more patterns you learned a little bit before. And so we'll talk some more about them this quarter
and so then there's verification and validation and quality assurance. This is about. And once again you've learned a little bit of this before. This is about
Defensive part of it is, the quality assurance is defensive coding techniques and then also testing right? And so you guys did get a little bit of exposure to unit testing. You know Picharm has a nice little framework that makes it easy to write your your unit tests for.
and so you'll do some more of that on your project. Actually, I have your little warmup assignment, the minesweeper thing that we're going to talk about this afternoon, and what you're what the 1st thing you'll do in your team is you'll look at one another's individual solutions to the minesweeper, and then you're going to come up with a team solution, and I will ask you to document the team solution and then also include some some unit tests to validate that. So.
And of course we'll go over those details specifically later. This is day one. This is a preview of the things that are coming. So
and we'll talk about the different types of testing. Yes, there's unit testing. And then we'll learn about. Oh, after that there's integration testing. And then there's system testing. And there's a lot of different flavors
of system testing. You know, there's usability testing, there's acceptance testing. There's regulations testing. If your if your software, you know, has to conform to certain, you know, perhaps international standards or safety or something like that. So so we'll talk about that.
And so also requirements and specifications. So we're going to learn about the software lifecycle formally this afternoon. Requirements and specifications which go hand in hand are 2 of the early steps in your software development lifecycle. And and we'll find out that the requirements and specifications is where you nail down the who, what, where, when.
and why of your software? So it's kind of a roadmap to what your software is about.
So and so one of the things that I'll have you guys do for your project is you'll do a draft document that contains the requirements and specifications. For your project. And of course, I'm gonna guide you through that. I have a template that you can use and kind of fill in the blanks for a lot of it, and then I have some examples for you to look at and borrow from, to build your own.
So we'll also talk about. So an important part of building software, especially with using agile methodologies where we where we work in iterations, or they're also called sprints, and our sprints will be one week in length, because that kind of works well, for what we're doing in academia and the limited amount of time we have together right quarter system. Some of you have worked with it before, I mean, all of you worked with it
last quarter fall quarter, but but many of you are used to semesters where you have a little bit more time to go through. Stuff quarters
themselves feel like a sprint, so they go pretty fast. So
so we'll have one week sprints or iterations for your project. And and so configuration management is is configuring all of the tools that are necessary for your software right and and managing them. And a lot of that involves automation where you can. So that you know, streamline the streamlines, the development process and just and and makes life a lot better for us overall.
And then, yeah, this is stuff we'll talk about at the end of the quarter cloud computing.
So we'll talk about some basic concepts of what it means to to develop code that's going to live in the cloud. And and the fact is, you'll get to live it in the 506 course. That's the capstone course here for the graduate certificate program. You'll you'll do cloud-based stuff you'll you'll build a little piece of software and it will live in the cloud so but I'll give you a
oh, I don't know a view from
50 feet above. So we'll dig in a little bit. We'll talk about Docker. We'll talk about Kubernetes. We'll talk about software as a as a service and micro services and some other things like that. So
anyways, and so, yeah, here's a, this stuff will change a little bit. This is not etched in stone. You know our tentative list of things. Obviously, course, intro, I want to talk to you about software lifecycle. That individual programming assignment group formation and do a little bit of review.
and then we'll talk about some software processes so agile and plan driven design. There's some patterns that I want to talk to you about the other thing that I actually moved. It shows week 3. I already moved this user stories and use cases. I'm going to talk to you guys about next week one of the things that I found. So I've taught this class
every time that it's been taught for the graduate certificate. So this is the 5th year. But but the other thing I mentioned is that this is similar to a undergraduate course. I teach it's numbered 360 really really similar content. The thing about our undergraduate curriculum is that the core language is Java and the core language. Here in the in the graduate certificate is python, but all the concepts are just about the same. So
and so one of the things that I always get every quarter. I teach the class whether it's in 360, or here in 504, is students are like Tom.
Can you get us into project mode sooner than later, because quarters go fast. And so, you know, that's part of what I have in mind is to get you into Project mode sooner than later, you know on the syllabus. Here I list the things that we're going to talk about. And I say, you know, week 5 is where the group project begins. I'm going to try and pretty much sure that I'll succeed.
I'll get us into Project Mode, I hope.
at the start of week 4. And and what it means
is that we're still going to be picking up some tools skills that are useful when you're in project mode. But it'll work out it. Just it just works out. It's fine. That's what I found. I used to worry. Well, we don't know about this yet. We don't know about this yet.
And and I hate to have you do something and then undo it. But the way that I'll introduce stuff that's not gonna be the case where you're gonna have to undo things. So so we'll be fine. And so then you can see yeah, user stories.
Where? I said, introduction to pivotal tracker and toggle. Those are project planning and timekeeping tools that I scrapped. So we're going to use you track instead. So I thought I had updated this. Maybe I forgot to save or something. But you track is what we'll use for for this stuff here. So the pivotal tracker toggle ignore it. I should probably just edit it right now. But
and so so yeah, we'll talk about the use case and user stories. One of the other things that I think is really important to talk about are these things called code smells? And those are those are potential problem areas in your code. And so they're an important part of agile development. And just and also what's called lean and clean software development. You need to be able to identify potential problem areas in your code
so that you can clean that stuff up. And so code smells are that they're potential problem areas in your code. And then we can talk about strategies. For when you identify, for example, one code smell is duplicate code, arguably, it's the worst code smell there is duplicate code. When you copy and paste and copy and paste and copy and paste all over. And the problem with that is, you've duplicated
the same concept. And when there's a problem with that concept. It's either logically flawed or syntactically flawed. Who knows? Then you got to go find all the places you pasted it and fixed it. And then the other thing is, what about testing? Well, then, you have to go and test it all over the place to make sure it works in all those different places. And so so we like to do things just once. In one place. Duplicate code is bad, and there's some strategies that we can employ
to avoid duplicate code where possible. So yeah, we'll talk about these code, smell things and they will help us refactor our code. And that's the formal term that's used for code cleanup.
Once again, agile methodologies. They like to keep a very clean code base, and as part of each iteration or sprint. What you like to do is have some time at the end of your iteration or sprint. Same thing to do, code cleanup. So to refactor your code. So
code smells can help us with that
alright. And so then there's software testing one of the other things that you're that I'm gonna introduce to you guys, this quarter is just a teeny, tiny bit of database stuff. So
and so I know that that some of you have database background. My expectation is you don't know a darn thing, you know, coming into this program. You know what are requirements for you guys to to join the graduate certificate program that you have a quarter or 2 or a semester or 2 of basic programming, you know. And and we do what we can with that bit of skill you have to get you up to speed. That's what that's what 501 and 502 are about. And and then we start. Then we start doing things are a little bit more interesting in in 503, and 504.
So sqlite is is a dbms. A database management system sometimes called the database engine.
and sqlite is is what's called ubiquitous. It's just everywhere. Okay. So so right now, for example. I'm using the chrome Google chrome web browser and underneath chrome uses sqlite.
the sqlite database to store stuff.
if you're if you're a Mac person, or you got an iphone or something. Ios uses sqlite underneath. If you did a quick Google search for sqlite uses, it's just all over the place. And so, and the reason it's so popular is because it's so easy to use.
it doesn't require you to stand up an actual database server that's live and living somewhere, it can just be part of an application. So so it's really nice. It's compact, it's portable. So we'll use sqlite. I require that you use it on your project, and I'll show you how to wire it in. I've got code examples, and then it's called sqlite, because it's a light version
of the SQL. Database engine, and so we'll learn a little bit of SQL. Structured query language. So it's the number one relational database language out there.
And so I want you to get a little bit of exposure to that for those of you that have some background in SQL. Already.
What we're going to learn here in 5 0, 4.
It's not SQL, 101. It's maybe SQL, 99. Don't worry about multiple tables. We don't worry about. You know, nested queries or multi table queries
and constraints and triggers, and we don't do any of that. It's just really simple. Hey? Look, here's how you connect to a database. Here's how you put some stuff in it. Here's how you read some stuff from it. So really simple mechanics. And the idea for me is to set you up so that in spring quarter, when you do your capstone course, where you will work with the database, you'll have had a little bit of exposure, and then you can learn some more and pick some more stuff up.
And the the other thing is is in the 505 course that Robert Cordingley is going to teach. So the systems programming course, we actually inserted a little module, even though it's not systems programming a little like couple week module where you just do SQL stuff. So because it's 1 of those skills that's just really nice to pick up as part of this program, the graduate certificate program in software development.
You just the natural place to store data for software is in a database. Okay, yeah, you can store it in a file and a lot of times that can suffice. But when you want to organize the data in some way, that's what a database is. It's a collection of files where the data is organized in some way. And you have tools that let you
ask meaningful things about the data and get results that you can use in a much more meaningful way than if you just threw them in a file. You'd have to do a lot of extra processing if you just threw the raw data in a file.
So so there's there's definitely some motivation for picking up the the SQL skills. And so we will. And so another thing I mentioned here is called Pickling. And so that's just the ability to save the information about objects that you have in memory and in python to a file, so to save it long term.
And so like, if you, there's a lot of different well, use cases, a lot of different scenarios where you might want to do this pickling thing save the information that's in memory about the objects in your software to a file on disk so that you can load it up later. Lots of different scenarios. But a big one is. Well, what if you wrote a game?
Okay, so pretty much any game that you play today. Not any game, but so many games.
You have the ability to save the game right and then load it later. And so Pickling lets you do that. And so 2 of the project options that I have for you are actually games and so
more on that later. But the reason that I choose that is that games are kind of a fertile playground for so many things that we talk about in the graduate certificate program as a whole, you use some algorithms, you use some creativity. You use object oriented design. It's important to do testing. And
you know, do things in an efficient fashion. So with good data structures and algorithms, you know it truly, playing games and programming games are 2 very, very different things.
So and so yeah, you get. They really let you put so many pieces together. And so and so that's why I do it. But we'll we'll also have a project that's not game based at all.
And so this mock object, dependency, injection, template method. Those are all design patterns, I said. We'll pick up some more. And so I've used all of these productively in industry. The mock object one
I I might talk about sooner than later. So so do understand. I list these. But because I get us into project mode earlier than I used to. We'll we'll get to stuff
sooner than later. And so, yeah, you can see some other things. Scrum is an agile methodology. So we'll talk about that cloud computing, getting towards the end of the quarter and then finals week.
I don't give a final exam, for that matter. I don't give a midterm exam, either, the way that things were structured with Veric where you had, you know, I don't know a couple 3 quizzes. That was the way I built it, unless he changed that. I don't think I saw that he changed that we'll probably do well at most 3 quizzes, maybe just 2.
I use them as sanity checks to make sure you're following along with the material that you're in a good place. It also gives me a feel for. Oh, boy, the class.
you know, on these couple of questions here. They didn't. They didn't get it right. So I need to do a better job of delivering that material, and so I'll circle back and and maybe come at stuff at another angle
if necessary. So
I did list. You know. There there used to be some individual homeworks that I would do but I I really, we get into project mode. I just have you do project. We have such a limited amount of time.
Right? I get you guys for 2 and a half hours a week formally, you know. I'll have some supplemental material for you, but but I don't want to completely overwhelm you. I know you've got to do the 5 0 3 stuff, and then you've got the other things that that are just a part of your world. So. So I'm very much considerate
of those items, and I do encourage you, you know, as your busy meter rises, certainly reach out to me and let me know some of you already, said Tom. I'm gonna have to miss this lecture. It's like totally fine. I record them. Watch the recording, and then bring your questions to me. I'm glad to get you back up to speed.
But but these are the things in. You know in general, that we're gonna be about this quarter like I said, the the list here will move around a little bit.
just so. You have a feel for for the different things that we're going to be or that I'm doing. Here's my contact info teaching a couple of undergrad courses. I mentioned 360. So that's the undergrad equivalent of this course, or vice versa. This 483 that I'm teaching. It's called secure coding principles, senior level elective.
I was fortunate enough. Gosh! I'm an old guy 20 years ago now I got to do a sabbatical at Microsoft and and understudy one of their top security guys at the time, and from what I learned from with him and his team. I built this secure coding principles course
so, and I sprinkle a little bit of the discussion from that course where I can into some of the things that we do in 504. Here's where I live on campus at Uwt.
Mcdonald Smith. Is the building. So 2 0 6 a I've got official office hours here. You guys get me right after class every Saturday. But I also have Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 1130 to 1230. You could zoom in. And just really important for you guys. Okay, because we are this online degree program.
I am available for appointment Monday through Saturday.
You just need to email me, okay, you guys get priority over my undergrad courses. Because you're online, and it's harder for you from a schedule standpoint, to meet with me. So I will make time for you if you need to meet, send me an email so easy for us to do a zoom, and I am very happy to do it. Don't ever be shy about reaching out to me about whatever. So and so also I I do my very best to keep up with email,
So that's another way to communicate. I I will say, though. Yeah, I'm a little bit older. Depending on. When in the evening you email me you might not hear back from me until the next morning. So you know I I do draw the line. It's like once it gets to 8 o'clock or something. It's like, well, you know, I'm gonna start winding down and and whatever. So?
so yeah, it might be the next morning, depending on when you email me, but I do my very best to answer in a timely fashion. I've got links here to the class, zoom, but that's also on the home page. And then there's my office hour zoom link.
And so, with regards to books, I don't formally require a text for this class I mentioned. There's an older book, and I have a Pdf. To an older version of it. I have enough slides and information such that
I I don't feel like. And this is feedback from previous classes, because we didn't use the text, we a ton, and they cost a lot of money. Yeah, you can go find the Pdfs, you know. But really, a lot of what I deliver is is just, here's some examples. Here's here's some slides I put together. I've also got some slides from A from an older book that are open source. And it's okay for me to use that. Get them that get the message across. So
So much of what we do is this project stuff and I'll talk about in lecture. Here are these things, you know that I want you to employ on your project. I'll have slides that go with it. I'll have code examples and it and it seems to work very well, but the feedback from previous cohorts in the grad certificate felt like the way things were being delivered was good. So I'm like, okay, let's not require a book.
I will note that from your 501, 502 the getting started with python. That is still a reasonable resource. I've got it open right here, and
as it loads again
The sections, I gotta move my zoom stuff here.
So under table of contents
you know what what we really care about. And it's some of the stuff, really, that you had in in 502. So the object oriented design stuff, you know. That's what 502 was supposed to introduce a lot of to you, but not all of it. I'll continue to introduce things. And so actually, part of the review. Today, I want to make sure we're all on the same page with what composition and inheritance is.
You know. And then there's this discussion of objects in python and you know, when to use it. So we'll we'll continue to build on that
object oriented shortcuts, and then some design patterns, some of which I'll introduce to you. But the book already talks about, and whenever we talk about design patterns I have slides on them. But I'll also say, Oh, there's you know, this book has some things to say about it as well. So and so. Yeah, there's not a.
you know, typically a specific set of readings that I have for you.
I did mention the book I used to require this Somerville text 9th or 10th edition. And here's just a Pdf. To this older one that's been around for a while. I have some slides from this book that we'll look at here and there, but but not very often. So you don't have these massive reading assignments. I want you writing code and live in code, and then I provide, like, I said, slides and links to material
that are going to be productive for you. On your project.
When I 1st started teaching software development and software engineering. I did it really from an academic standpoint. Here's this book that talks about all these things, all these different, you know, paradigms. And oh, and here's Uml. And here's sequence diagrams. And here's activity diagrams, you know, and learning all these mechanics. And then but as I spent time in industry I found. Well, that's good to have as background. But
the important things are. Let's write code. Let's talk about how to write good, clean code and how to how to clean it up when it's not.
And how do we write code so that it's testable and understandable by others? And so design patterns help with that. So those are the most valuable lessons that I learned from industry. And my assumption is that ultimately, with this degree, you're going to either work in industry. Or maybe you go get a Master's degree and then work in industry, or you've already got a job. And the skills you pick up here, you're going to try and build some software. And so
so yeah, I try to take out all this book stuff that
it's a lot of busy work, and it tends to not get used as much so. And once again, like I said, what I deliver now is based on feedback from previous cohorts, and it seems to work pretty well so, and you're always welcome to talk to me about stuff. So I have some some other resources. The one that I list here on the bottom has headfirst design patterns.
This is one of my favorite books.
I think it was originally printed in 2,004. There might have been a single update in 2,008. But the patterns are the patterns they don't change. And these are the things that I've lived, you know, in industry, pass on to you. And so so this is a book which is free via the Uw. Library. If you just if you go to the library, and I've got a link right here to the to the Uw. Library.
if you just do a search oops. That's my canvas page. If you do a search here and you put, that's even. It's here from before headfirst design patterns.
Okay, you could do a Google search and find the Pdf. For it, because it's an older book, but it's available here.
So so there it is. Yeah, way back in in 2,004. But then they it looks like they updated it.
in 20. 0, this jeez, I wasn't keeping up 2,008. They have an update as of 2020. So anyways I'll let you know it's like, but I mostly I just have slides, and I'll say, Hey, this is where these slides come from. And so so headfirst design patterns could be an additional resource. For you guys.
So anyways, we're working towards it's 2, 34. We've been grinding almost for an hour. Let me get through
Hope that's 502
reviewing what you guys knew from there. So yeah, the hardware you had from before. Whatever you know, version of Pycharm and and Python you're using python 3 is fine.
There's there's outcomes and goals, which matter, but we'll live them. I'm not going to read through all these. You can look at them. We live that stuff.
You're in the class. So you met the Prereqs.
There's a list of that stuff
in terms of when you have questions for me. You know, you you guys have degrees. The more information you give me when you have a question the better off you know, the better it is, the easier it is for me to answer your question and do a good job.
I do prefer that you use uw, email. Uw, technically says if you don't use your Uw email, you know, when you're asking about grades, or or just any course, content really, that you know, because it because maybe you're not who you say you are. I'm not supposed to answer. I always do. But try and use your Uw email. The other thing is canvas lets you email me directly.
And and I ask that you don't do it. It's really convenient for you.
But canvas is problematic when we go back and forth with emails, and especially if there's attachments, it doesn't manage that stuff really. Well, at least like for my email client. And it's like I need to log into canvas to actually go and look at all of that stuff. So if you have just a real quick, you know what I just need to let Tom know I'm not going to be there. I got a quick clarification. It's like Tom. You said the quiz was going to be on this day, you know, on canvas. Am I right? If it's 1 of those, you know, it's going to be a quick thing.
and I can do an answer. And then we're done. Okay, canvas is fine. I mean, I'm always gonna respond to you if you use canvas. I just know that, like with attachments and stuff and going back and forth, the email thread stuff canvas is not great, so
try and avoid it. If it's anything other than a quick and dirty this is, be a single answer from Tom, and then done
so. I do hope that you can attend these synchronous lectures. I think it adds a lot for you to be in person and have the ability to ask me questions. And it's always okay to drop a question in the chat. I said this at the start of lecture this afternoon.
You know I'll try and note you've got a question in the chat and stop and answer it. But it's also okay to unmute and just go, hey, Tom, real quick clarification on that. So like I said, I'm pretty casual. I do want to be respectful of everyone's time, and of course you do as well. But but it's okay to do that. So do try and show up where you can, understanding that. Yeah, sometimes you're busy and the lectures will all be recorded. And I showed you zoom recordings. Cloud cloud recordings is where the stuff will live.
I have this thing.

For a second. Can I interject.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
01:05:02
Yeah. Sure. Go ahead.
James  Godwin

01:05:03
Regarding canvas. It's like, that's the only way I know of how to properly email you for email, anyone in the Uw ecosystem like, how can I access like, how do I email you at your Uw email without being in canvas? Because normally, I would be using like a private personal email.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
01:05:20
Yeah, so.
James  Godwin
James  Godwin
01:05:21
Thing like, how do I actually do that without using canvas? Is my question.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
01:05:25
Yeah, outlook is the official email client. So so uw, underneath is using
is using outlook. Or or I mean you, there's ways. You can use other clients, but it's it's Microsoft based. So if you go to let me drop this and let me stop the share. That's a good question. I'm glad you asked. This is these are the things we need to talk about. You should be able to go to. I'm just typing this in the chat outlook.com slash uw.edu.
Okay? Oh, I didn't put https in front of it. So
let me let me do that and see if that'll work. Https Colon slash, slash, outlook, dot
dot com slash uw.edu.
So there you should be able to enter your you know your Uw email address that that net Id, and it'll ask you to do an authenticate and stuff.
There, you know, there's a handshaking process that goes through it. But I'll go back to to my screen share here.
And so yeah, you can see. Oh, there's Tom's email. Hopefully, there's not any mischief here.
Well, there's someone from my
from from one of my other classes. They can't.
They got them. They gotta they gotta drop the class, whatever. So but but yeah outlook.com slash uw.edu. You should be able to log in and and manage your stuff.
There! There's an authentication process that it wants you to go through.
But but that's what I use. And it works fine. You can. There's other whatever email client you want. But it ultimately goes through office.
So that's that's what Uw is using.
Yeah, I will. If you send me something from Gmail or something. I'll always answer you. But
this is the syllabus stuff, and so this I have some kind of
copy and paste stuff that's in all of my syllabi for all of my courses. And
the graduate certificate. What you guys are a part of is a little bit unique because it's this online course or online certificate. And you know, you guys are coming from outside the Uw system. For the most part, most of you are so. So some of what you see is is kind of well, this this is. This is just how we're doing stuff in house. But but yeah, you should be able to to use that client that I just showed you
and log in and there's a single sign on thing like, I said. And
it'll want to do some 2 factor authentication. And have you set that stuff up? And which to me, while the 2 factor authentication can be a little bit irritating in this day and age, with all of the attacks that are out there, and all the mischief that can happen. You know I mentioned, I teach a course called secure coding principles. Anything we can do to avoid mischief if it's a little extra work on our part, but it avoids mischief.
I'm I'm I'm okay with, you know.
some of you maybe, have been the victims of identity theft. I almost had someone redirect as this was at my previous institution, they were able to hack into the underlying system, and they were almost able to to change the bank account that my checks got deposited to
thank goodness, person at Payroll, got a hold of me and called me, and saying, Tom, are you changing your bank account to this place in California
like no, and so, you know, I was completely oblivious to it, and it wasn't anything that I did wrong. It was a it was a hole in the system. So
so 2 factor. Authentication is a positive thing.
So anyways try that out the outlook.com slash uw.edu. And so that's 1 venue through which that you can do stuff. If you use the outlook
app just on your machine.
that's another way that you can do it. But but just the web based version should suffice. So
so yeah, thanks for that question, James, because I'm sure others had it.
And so I have this thing about study groups. You guys are gonna work in teams. That's your study group. But you're welcome to talk to whoever
academic integrity. So so this is one of those things that's important to address. I
you know I want you to do your own work, and yet we don't work in a vacuum in terms of things that are out there and tools. And so for your project.
you know, as long as most of the code that your team writes is yours.
I'm fine. You know. I don't want you running to chat Gpt or Gemini, and having everything built.
they can do a lot, but not everything.
You know. Certainly. You want to build up your skill set
so that when you well, well, you gotta take courses next quarter like the capstone. But when you sit down for an interview.
especially a technical interview, you know you can kind of stand on your own feet as far as that goes. And or if you decide to go into a master's program in computer science somewhere, you've built the proper skills. I mean, you guys get it. It's not about getting the answers. It's how you get them. And the journey for the most part needs to be yours. I'm going to talk to you guys. I hope this afternoon a little bit about the ais, and actually
for your 1st team-based assignment, which is going to be to take the minesweeper thing and do a team solution. I actually am going to have you use an AI to build some test data
for your team solution. So we'll talk about that. AI is here to stay. You know, it's changed the landscape a little bit in the software engineering or in the software software industry in the sense that some some of the kind of
internship level things that had you do a lot of grunt work well, the Ais can do that grunt work now, because there's not a lot of thinking involved. And you know, that's the thing about the ais is they're not really thinking they're they're doing stuff based on a lot of probabilities. It's a numbers game. They have built databases of knowledge. Those are called expert systems.
So they've had to train them and been able to train things. But but the ais
still have many, many shortcomings, and a human brainpower is still going to be required for for some time, you know, into the future, at least in my opinion. And and when I was a grad student, my focus area was AI. Now that was 20 plus years ago, but but I keep up with it, and so I'll show you some things that AI can do and and then stuff. It's not good at. So
so anyways, what I would say is that any code that you don't write yourself?
You know that you turn in as part of your project, or whatever, make sure you give credit to it, and just like Oh, here's a link to to wherever I found this thing, or you know I used. I use chat Gpt, to generate this little snippet right here. You know I'm fine with that, because it's like I said the AI is here to stay, and and we want to learn to use it productively, and where I can I'll sprinkle that in or say, Hey, I want you to use this thing here, this AI to help with the following task, here in 504.
So.
and so, yeah, there's discussion of of this kind of stuff, and then there's expectations. And so you know, I'm your grader for this class.
15 of you are formally enrolled. I don't know if if others, you know, are going to continue on with the program or not. But 15 of you are enrolled, and and what I do is when you turn something in. I try and get it back to you within a week.
I'm teaching 2 other courses, but I have graders for those courses.
So that means you guys get my priority grading wise. So that's good. And you're also a priority because your graduate certificate and you're paying a lot of money for this stuff. So I recognize that. And I care. I don't see any of that money that just goes to, you know, to the program the skill of engineering and technology. But I care.
Believe me, it's a lot of money, so respect respect for that. So so I'll get stuff back to you in as timely a fashion as possible. I try and do it within a week, if I'm running behind at all. And and just like you guys, life happens for me. I will let you know where stuff is at in terms of grading. But it's not typically a problem should be okay.
I follow the Uw grade scale which you know on the on the surface. Is pretty steep, but I can also say that here in in 504, especially.
The points are pretty easy to come by. It's like, if you do your work. If you put in your weekly hours. You know, I said. We'll have a couple 3 quizzes, and I always post a study guide for the quiz, and I also allow you to have a cheat sheet for the quiz, and you just build it off the Study Guide. I don't care how many pages your cheat sheet is. It could be 43. I don't care.
because if you're building a cheat sheet, then that means you're studying, which makes me happy. And then you just refer to that stuff, you know, on the quiz. And then the quizzes are usually some true, false, multiple choice. It's pretty pretty similar to what I what veric delivered to you because I built that stuff
so. And so the grades tend to run pretty high here. If you do your work, you come to lecture, you turn your stuff in on time, the grades going to take care of itself, and you know your expectation should be that you earn a 4 0 or darn close to it. That's been my experience for the most part in the 4 previous times that I taught 504.
So I've got a grade breakdown there it is, you know, mostly assignments, and then quizzes. I say 3. If we end up only doing 2 quizzes, then I'll change it so that the weight isn't 25%. It'll be less than that. I'm not going to make 2 quizzes count for 25% of the grade.
My late policy is one day late, 10% 2 days late, another 10%. So 20% total. And then after that, I won't accept it. So and so this is one of those. It's a pretty simple game. You guys are mature. You've already got a degree. If life is happening to you, reach out to me, especially if you let me know ahead of time. Tom, I've got this thing going on
all right. I don't know if I can get this thing turned in. Can I have an extra day? Can I have 2 extra days if you let me know ahead of time? The answer is like 99.9. 9 something. Yes, it's gonna be okay.
Just let me know. Or if life happens, you know you get sick. You get in an accident. I don't know, you know. Reach out to me. We'll work it out. But this is this is the official contract stuff. This is the bad cop stuff. So just reach out to me as necessary. This hasn't been a big problem in the graduate certificate program.
Which is one of the reasons I love, and I'm willing to give up a Saturday. Just like you guys, I get to hang around with some people that have already got a degree and have some passion to learn about writing code and software, which is my world. So I really do love working with you guys. And we'll have a good time.
So contestant grades. Once you get feedback from me, reach out to me like within a week. If there's something wrong. If I screwed something up or you felt like I didn't treat you fairly on something. I'm happy to talk to you about it, but but it's it's really rough coming to me, you know, during Finals week, saying, Hey, you know, back in the second week I want to talk to you about these points and these other points. It's like, let's take care of it, then, while it's fresh. So so one week, that's what I say. One week.
religious accommodations, any other kind of accommodations support wise, really simple. You guys reach out to me. Let me know what you need, so I can get you what you need. I want to make sure you're taken care of. You just need to let me know. So I am happy to work with you, and very respectful of of any kind of religious you know, issue that you have, or you're dealing with
and for that matter, disability, you know, if you have disability support and and the school lets me know about that. But reach out to me. I will work with you. Okay, just it's just not a problem. Okay. So
I am here to work with you and and get you ready to build software, get you ready for industry. Okay? So this always takes a long time to go over this logistical stuff. Which is why I said, you know, maybe maybe we ran a little bit long here this 1st day, just so we can. So we can get to some other things. And so it's it's very much time for a break. So we're at 2 50. And so, like, I said, we usually do a 10 min break, so let's go ahead and take our 10 min. Break right now.
and we will start back up at at 3 o'clock, and then we'll continue with that agenda, so have a good break. Go get a beverage, walk around whatever you need to do. I'll see you at 3.
Here we go
alright. So we're gonna jump back into it. I went over a lot of logistical stuff
a lot to absorb. But remember, it's all recorded, so you can review it later. Were there any questions about anything that I talked about, any, any concerns there, from our initial discussion.
feel free to either unmute and ask or or drop something in the chat. Anything, you guys.
So, James, you do have a question, or are we good?
Okay, alright.
I am curious. I have a question for you guys real quickly, because I see
there's 8 of you here, 15 registered at least. I saw that on my roster.
Did anybody look at how many showed up with Kevin this morning? Was it about the same? Were there 8 of you or more.
anybody know? Didn't we look.
Sean Warlick
Sean Warlick
01:19:48
It was pretty much the same group.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
01:19:50
Okay.
And so once again, I understand. Alright. So Janine says, 11. So and I know some people had emailed me and said. They got some stuff going on today on some family events, and so
I always hope that people come and hang out with me, you know, in person. I'm selfish that way. No, I just like, I said. I like the interaction, and I like the back and forth and the feedback, and I think it really can enhance. The learning environment overall.
As opposed to just recorded and canned. And yeah, yeah, okay, so let's move on. Thanks for that.
Okay, then, for the last hour.
Very good. So appreciate the appreciate the info. I just, I, just yeah.
Fundamentally, I want everybody to be successful. So whatever that takes, that's what I care about.
Alright. So let me go back to the screen share.
And hey, we got through the syllabus, and so let me look at. Let's look at that agenda
that I had posted for you under module one
So what I I'm gonna I'm gonna jump ahead. I kind of thought about this over break.
I want to.
I want to take a look at the little. The team info thing that I have posted. Not that it's tricky, but I want to talk about it a little bit, and then I'm going to go ahead and talk about the little warmup assignment that I have for you. I want to spend time on that, because those are things that you have to deal with most immediately. So I want to make sure and get through that. And then you can see there's some problem solving stuff. And
and then some review things hopefully, you've talked about the pillars of ol at some point from 502, but we'll review it to make sure we're on the same page, and then and then some other stuff, too. So
so yes, let's go to.
Let's go to and close that one and that than that.
Okay,
okay, so here's the team formation. So hopefully, you saw this. And I can see that. Well, 2 people have submitted.
Okay? And and so, yeah, I've set this I I'd like you to submit something by tomorrow before the clock strikes midnight, and so the reason for that is then I can form teams, and then I'll post an announcement on canvas for you guys with, Hey, here's your team assignments.
and and then you can get. Then you can start working on
well, your team assignment and I won't activate that until I form the teams. But I've already told you what I'm going to have you do on your teams. You're going to look at each other's solutions for minesweeper. And then you're gonna come up with a team solution and I don't care how you build the team solution, you could say, oh, so and so, solution is really good. Let's just use that. Or you can make a hybrid, or you can start from scratch and build it together.
I don't care. The point will be, of course, that you look at the code style of your team members. Certainly, python manage or mandates some some code style.
and the things that I expect stylistically from you guys are just to follow the naming standards or naming conventions that the Python community has, and you've already been exposed to those in 501 and 502. So no changes from what I'm having you do, although I can say, my friends, that one of the things that I'm very particular about.
and so let me just go to.
I'm gonna open up.
There's my agenda make a new
text document. But I'm going to change this and just call it code.py.
yeah, yeah, I want to change it, and
I want to open it in notepad.
So
and so one of the things I'll bring up for you guys. That's really important. And and so I'll just I'll I'll type it and and say it this way.
well.
so all instance fields.
In any class you write should be private.
Okay.
So so should be private.
how do you make something private? So so this is a little bit of review, and then we'll then we'll move on, but this is a big deal to me. How do we make something private
in Python? Hopefully, you were introduced to this in 5 0, 2. It's old news. Eric told you. How do you make it, Pop? Private? Anybody? You can drop it in the chat, or you can unmute.
Okay, so Maddie's got it. All right. Maddie is spot on double underscore.
2 underscores in front of any instant. Field names makes them private. Technically, there's a way you can get around it. But it lets anybody else that's writing. Python. Know, it's private.
Okay? Now, I see that Sean put a single underscore.
Okay, that does mean something. Okay, and it's better than public. But and this is one of those I got to get a feel for what you guys know or absorbed. And this is best. This is especially from 502. Does anybody? What's a single underscore mean? It's not private
anybody. Did you talk about it?
Yes, protected Maddie's on it. It means protected.
Okay? And so one more thing, and then we'll move on. I'll go back to the other stuff. Okay, this is, this is good, all right. This gets us all on the same page, if some of you weren't sure. Now, you know.
there's only one time, really, there's only one time when you're designing in the in the object oriented world
where you want to make something protected.
When do you want to make something protected anybody
once again. Chat is fine, or you can just unmute just one time.
anybody know.
And so, by the way.
and maybe you guys just don't know. And that's fine, I'm gonna tell you, of course, but the more that you participate and the more that you contribute.
then the more I get to know you. And so then, when you guys are applying for master's programs.
then I'm like, I know, this person. They come to lecture, they participate, they ask questions, they answer questions. And so then I can just say more good things about you. So I always want to say good things about you, and it helps if I get to know you.
So.
Jannine G. D. MacGormain
Jannine G. D. MacGormain
01:27:23
Well.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
01:27:23
Yes, janine.
Jannine G. D. MacGormain
Jannine G. D. MacGormain
01:27:25
You use protected to restrict access from to a variable and methods or class members.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
01:27:37
That is true, but when you declare something protected, so thank you for that.
When you declare something protected, who is allowed to access, or what is allowed to access something that's protected.
So.
Sean Warlick
Sean Warlick
01:27:54
Anybody can get to it. You just have to call it with the underscore. It's a naming convention.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
01:28:00
Well, it. It's a naming convention. Yeah, but but it's protected. And so when you declare something protected, Sean.
what do you have in mind. I made this protected. What does that really mean? Well, what it means? I'm just going to say it.
It's about inheritance.
Okay.
you declare something protected protected is is only about inheritance, and what you would do is in a class that's going to be a parent class.
all right, sometimes called a base class, and then, like in Java, it's called the super class. So it's a parent class.
all right. And so, if you declare something protected, what that says is that child classes are allowed to directly access
are allowed to directly access that thing. That's that's declared protected.
Okay, that's the only purpose in life. We're protected. It's for inheritance.
So, and it's a finer point that a lot of times it doesn't make it through
from early programming courses like 502. I see the same thing when I'm teaching in the undergraduate courses. The core courses there. 1, 42, 1, 43 same thing protect its purpose in life is all about inheritance, and it's I have a parent class, and some class is going to inherit from it. It's okay for the child class that's inheriting from it to access this. But the rest of the world, things that aren't part of the inheritance hierarchy
are not allowed to access this. So so it's more restrictive than just wide open, which is called public
right? And then the double underscore is private. And so, you know, when you're in Python, because Python is a dynamic language. It just figures things out, you know, as you go. You don't have to compile it like so many other programming languages. Write the code and run it. And so and so, you know, Sean pointed out something that's really important. With with the
with the single underscore
you can. You could access a field with just a single underscore from any other class.
All right, python won't stop you from doing it.
but anybody that understands python and understands oo, when they see that single underscore it says that's protected. I shouldn't be trying to access this directly and hopefully. The person that wrote the class and made it protected, provided a means for you to access it
otherwise. And so I know you guys have been exposed to getters and setters right. So get methods to return the value of an underlying field instance field that should be private and a setter is there to change, to allow for changing
the value of some underlying instance field that's private that has the 2 underscores. And and hopefully, you learned from from 502 that those setters, whatever values passed in the parameter of the method that you're going to assign. You know, for example, if you, if you had a student class and you had a field called Gpa
you know, and that and that Gpa
you had underscore underscore gpa
and so you decided to have a set Gpa method.
you know, that had as as a parameter the new Gpa that's being passed in right. You you want to make sure in a set method that what's passed in looks. Okay?
Right? And so you know, in the context of, if if you knew that Gpa is is going to be a real number, you know a double.
Then then you could check to make sure it's an instance of
a double, and and then the other thing is. Then you check and make sure. The range that it was in right was, you know, like, from 0 point 0 to 4.0 something like that.
Did you guys get? So once again, I gotta find find out what you know. For sure.
Did you guys talk about properties?
All right. Properties, or or they're also known as decorators in python.
That that work for getters and setters does that sound in any way, shape or form familiar.
Yeah, we do. We do use them on a couple of the assignments.
Okay, you did.
Sean Warlick
Sean Warlick
01:32:15
The drawing assignment, I think, was expected.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
01:32:17
Okay, thanks, Sean. No, this is good. So, and I can see Maddie's. Yep, Rusty James is like not strongest skill. I will do another example for you, not today. We don't worry about it. But those property things are. They're just awesome. Okay, they're really nice. They're a good, defensive, programming thing. They're part of writing a good, clean code base, and so I will deliver some content for you.
It's good that you've seen it, but I will clarify and and try and and try and make more clear. Perhaps you know why you'd want to use those things. So thank you. Guys, this is this is what we need to do right? We're on the same team. And so we'll get you where you need to be but I'm always gonna need your help.
So.
Jannine G. D. MacGormain
Jannine G. D. MacGormain
01:32:58
Perfect.
Professor Tom, I have a question.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
01:33:02
Yes, please.
Jannine G. D. MacGormain
Jannine G. D. MacGormain
01:33:04
Is that properties
different from that properties about attributes and methods wherein properties have types, values and ids. And the method is sort of part of that properties for an object.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
01:33:24
Yeah. So so your your attributes or or properties the the properties thing right? And you can use the app for it. I'll give you guys a syntax example. But they basically are shorthand for having your getters and setters
that are associated with a with an underlying instance field that you want to be private, so
they look like
you kind of declare them, and they look like methods, but but when you use them they kind of look like a variable. You declare them. They look like methods, but you use them. They look like a variable. I will give you guys a code example. So right now, day one.
I'll give you a nice set of clarification. I'll probably deliver that next week, because that's a that's an easy thing to talk about and so I'll have a code example for you next week, and if I can post it, yeah, you bet if I can post it sooner than next Saturday. You know. I'll get it up there on Module 2, and I'll and I'll post an announcement that says, Hey, here's a little example of properties for you guys, and we'll talk about it on Saturday. So
excellent! Excellent!
So so anyways, back to this team formation thing.
so so I just want you to give me all right. What's your name? What's your Uw email address? So you can that that way, because what you're going to do is once I form teams, you'll contact your team members. Figure out how you guys want to communicate with one another. What your schedules look like, you know. Maybe you want to use something like discord to to talk to each other. It doesn't matter to me what you use.
And so, yeah, what operating system or systems do you work on or prefer?
I try. I mean, there, you can learn. It's like
one person uses Linux. One person uses Mac.
One person uses windows. There's a lot that can be gained for. Well, it's a little bit different here, and a little bit different here. I usually try and put people, though, that maybe are working in the same OS
cause. It can simplify things a little bit, you know. Avoid some potential issues.
So, so, yeah, I look at that. And then you know, list, what programming languages, you know. And then you know your level of ability or what you think right. And and you're not doing this level of ability
based on industry. You know, it's it's from an academic standpoint which is very different. And you know and I I would say, you know, if if you guys
1st started using python here in the graduate certificate, you know. And so you've gone through 501 and 502, and if you you know, I expect you did pretty well in those courses. You know you, you could say.
your your level of ability is intermediate for us. It's academic, right? That's fine. If you use the word proficient. Okay, you know, if you feel that you're pretty comfortable with it. Okay.
I'm not gonna nickel and dime and say, Well, are you really proficient. So this is helps me form teams, especially for those that that don't know others. And you know, I try and put complementary skills on a team
where I can.
And so, yeah, the other thing is, have you done any Gui development? You know menus and buttons and those kinds of things. Have you done that? Have you done anything that's web based? Have you done any Javascript? Have you done any? HTML, css.
none of these things, by the way, in terms of gui or web technology, or mobile platform or database. None of this is necessary for the project. This just tells me what each of you know, and then I can try and put together teams, especially those that don't self form
to to kind of put some complementary skills together to to maybe allow for some flow of information back and forth between you, so that so that more than one person can serve in a mentor role, you know. And and you can end up with a good product.
And so, yeah, have you done anything mobile? Wise, you know. Have you done any android development.
And a lot of you will say, Tom, I haven't done any of this. I just am starting in the program, and that's fine. But some of you, I know, have a reasonable amount of background already. Have you done anything with databases?
Okay?
You know. And this second question with databases, almost the same thing. Do you know, SQL, have you done some nosql stuff?
doesn't matter. Just background info. And then so this is important. This is optional. You don't have to do this.
So names of of people that are in the class that you want to form a team with. And so I do allow you to do this.
The perfect size based on the projects that I have is a team of 3. Okay, I've done teams of 4 before, and it can work. I worry sometimes if there's 4, is there enough work to go around? But you can always do extra things you can enhance the things that I ask you to do on the projects. You know, and we'll see if I have time to get to the projects, because there's so much to talk about this 1st day.
I'll talk about them for sure next week if I don't talk about them today. So 3 is kind of the sweet spot to to form a team. The other thing is, if there's 1 other person that you know a little bit and you've worked with, you can say, well, you know, here, here's the 2 of us we'd like to work together, and at least from an enrollment standpoint. There's 15 enrolled
so that divides evenly by 3. So I hope for teams of 3. So what you could say is, Hey, there's the 2 of us. We'd like to work together, Tom. We worked a little bit together in 502, or 501, and then just give us a 3rd person if somebody else needs a team. So you can. Just you can just let me know that
I mean, even though we have 15, you know, maybe somebody else still has to sign up. They just haven't gotten their tuition stuff taken care of. So it's okay to also say.
if we need to work as a team of 2, Tom, we're okay with that. So you can put that down as well.
Okay, I just want to do the best I can to set you up for success, and I know that some of you worked together last quarter. You'd like to do so again. Then that's great. So you can list, you know. Here's who I'm forming a team with. Make sure you talk to those people, and they say the same thing. It's kind of awkward when I have 2 people. Oh, yeah, we're working on. These are the 3 of us. And then the 3rd person either doesn't say anything at all, or says they're working with someone completely different, which I've seen before. I've seen all that.
So do coordinate with your people. If you do want to work together. And then, you know, this is a thing, you know. Maybe maybe you cross paths with somebody last quarter, and and there was some friction. You know, even though real world you, you have to work with people that you know you butt heads with, or whatever I don't want you to have to do that here in in 504. So it is okay to list. Hey, I just
something. I'm not sure. Just some interactions. I just. I'm not comfortable, could be. You know, I'm a type, a. This person is a type, a I just know we're going to butt heads. I'd prefer not to work with that person. So so you can list that. And I'm the only one that views this stuff. Of course I'm the grader for this course. So this is between you and me. And so, yeah, if you're worried about that, please go ahead and list that, and I will not put you on a team with someone that you say, Yeah, I don't want to work with that person, so I'll do my very best.
And so, as I mentioned, you can self form, try and find 2 others, but if it's just one other, you know, you can say, Assign us a 3, rd Tom, then that works, and so make sure everybody that you want to work with says the same set of names.
Okay? And then, yeah, for the rest of you. You know I want you to get this stuff posted by by tomorrow night before the clock strikes midnight, and so then on Monday, Monday's a busy day for me, but but then for sure, Tuesday, I'll grab stuff, and then I'll form the teams, and and I'll tell you that if you self form a team of 3.
That's your team. I'm gonna I'll give you that same thing. If you do a team of 2 I I'll try and keep you together. Unless I end up with these multiple pairs of 2, and I've got it like, well, I'd like teams of 3, probably in terms of the workload. So once again, try to do right by you. So so that's what's going on with this team. Info thing. Not supposed to be tricky pretty easy. 5 points. Just jot this stuff down. And if you got people you want to work with put their names down
any questions, any questions.
Okay, alright, not seeing anything in the chat.
I'll take that as a positive sign, alright, closing that tab.
all right. And so and so then there's this piece that this little warm-up readiness.
And so this is one of those.
Hopefully, this isn't difficult. I'm going to walk through and and talk about the specifics of this assignment. I I see that there's a couple of submissions,
or or see one submission, anyway. And so
so yeah, what I found in this certificate program was that previously there were some students, you know, maybe kind of barely got through 501, 502, and just from a skill set standpoint, just writing basic code. They weren't where they needed to be. And so, you know.
I want students to be set up for success. And so this is just a little sanity check.
And so, you know, I say, try and do this without without outside help. If you're stuck.
I will help you.
Okay, and you know I'll say that I I posted this last week, and I set the deadline for January 14.th So that's 3 days from now. I can give you a little more time, if you need. I don't mind, but I also know that I'm going to form teams, and then your teams are going to look at each other's solutions, and you're going to build a team solution that you'll have to document, and you'll have to do some unit testing for and some other busy work. So anyways. So so let's talk about this problem.
yeah. And and some things to to watch out for here or to not do. So, it's okay to Google for python syntax examples. But don't Google for a solution to this problem. It's a really old problem. It's been around, you know, since, like the late nineties, there's solutions out there for this, you know. Could you Google for it? And could you turn it into me? And could I? You know I have a bunch of the solutions, you know. Could you do it and turn it in and
change names. And Tom doesn't know. Yeah, you probably could.
But this is a sanity check. If you got to go Google and find a solution to this.
Well, then, the team project thing is going to be really, really hard for you, and it's going to be hard for you to contribute meaningfully
to that project. So
so yes, try and do it on your own, and if you're stuck, come, see me. Let's do a zoom. I will help you. Okay, I don't. This is not a get rid of people. This is a make sure you're where you need to be. Reach out to me. Let's talk about where you're where you're a little bit deficient. I'll help you through the solution and try and get you to a place where you're comfortable so that you can be an effective team member. So so that's really my point of view, I'm not gonna disenroll anyone. It's just oh, my, if you can't do this.
Then I'm worried. So
and so yeah, we'll go through the problem statement, you know, hopefully, you've already read it. But I'll go through it so that so that we can formalize the the process. But before I do that, it's really important to note that the input to your program is guaranteed to be well formed. All right. So your input is going to live in a file. And you're just going to read from that file
inputs guaranteed to be well formed, no error checking is necessary. So so the problem statement that we're about to look at. Excuse me.
it says, the input looks like this, you're guaranteed. It looks like that. Okay? So sometimes it's called programmer or or user Utopia, the user, or whoever it is, is providing the data. They are the ideal perfect. They're not going to cause any mischief.
And so so the input to your program. I want you to read from a file. And and it very specifically would be called minds dot txt, okay, lowercase. And I actually have the sample of it right here.
And it's a big file. It has a lot of stuff, and I have a you know, I have a disclaimer there, let me go open it.
Okay, so it's got a lot of stuff, big old file.
And and so what I say is, don't test your 1st solution on this. Now, some of you are pretty good already, and maybe all of you are, and you're like, Tom, I'm confident I'll run it. It'll work. I just. It's like, test it on something simpler. Cause I cause. I don't want you to be overwhelmed. I want you to be successful. So anyways, so
so you'll ultimately you need to run your program against that file right there. Minestxt. And then I want you to write the output from your program to a file called Minesweeper output dot txt.
Okay? And really important. Okay, and this is part of it's programming contest stuff leak code technical interviews. The output has to be formatted precisely as specified. And so we'll go over that.
Okay,
And so in case you didn't have any exposure whatsoever in 501 or 502 to file input and output. I've got a little piecharm project. I actually have it open in Pycharm, and I'll show you that once we go over the project specs. So in case you haven't dealt with files before. So I have some code that you can use, and it's formatted such that it's pretty easy to tweak it
for the minesweeper thing. So so, not surprisingly. And so, yeah, you'll test your program with this mindstxt. And then the output. So here's output. Your output should be identical to the output that I provide right here. So for that input called mindstxt
me download this your program's output needs to look exactly
like this one right here? Exactly.
Okay. And so,
and so one of those things is, well, how can we check if if my programs output is exactly the same as this official output. And so I have some things down below
that says that if you're running Mac OS or Linux, you can open up a terminal
also known as a command. Prompt. And then you can use. There's a command called Diff
Alright, and it's really simple. Where's the where's the
let me do a new one here.
So so if you're if you're running Mac OS, or if you have any running, Linux, is this diff?
1st file space, second file, and and then you just press. Enter.
and if there's something that's not the same about them, it'll tell you
on the windows side. If you opened up a command prompt. There's a command called Fc. Which is short for file. Compare, and it's the same thing. File one txt file, 2 txt, all right, so you could do those. But then you might say, Tom.
I don't know what a terminal is, or this command prompt thing. We didn't do any of that stuff in 501 or 502, I'm not exposed to it. So there's online tools here. There's this diff checker. And there's text, compare.
And so like text, compare
you just take one file, you paste, copy and paste it. There. You take the other one copy and paste it, and then you hit the compare button, and it'll tell you. And if it says they're the same, okay, you got the right output, and if not, you look and see, and then you go change your solution where you're doing your output stuff
so that it matches.
Okay? So anyways, there's that part. Let me close that.
Okay,
And so I do say, you know, as we go through these other pieces,
So for your solution. You'll place everything in a Zip file with your last name, 1st initial of your 1st name. If it was me.
Paul, T. Warm up. Okay. And so in there your source file. The fact is.
if you make a Pi churn project, you can just put the project folder in there. Okay, I do. I do want you to do this. Put a little file called Readme dot txt.
Okay, that has the following, I'm interested in knowing.
Okay, I'm not. It doesn't. It's not a points thing I don't. I don't
care how long it took it. Just how long did it take you to get this done?
And then, hey, let me know. What did you did you have some problems? What do you have problems with? You're like? Well, I didn't do the file. I/O stuff, Tom, before Tom, or I didn't know this diff thing. So I tried this diff thing. It took me a while to figure it out, and then, you know, if something doesn't quite work, or you know can't work or something, then include that as well.
So also in the Zip. So you'll put that your source files, and it's okay to have your pie charm project.
This read me, minds, dot txt, which is this file that I posted above
alright, and then minesweeper output. And so that's the output that you got from running your program. So that means you're going to write to a file called minesweeper output dot txt. And like, I said, I have a code example.
and you do need to make sure that your output is identical. Okay.
to the official output like I just said, and talk about the ways that you can go about that. And then a couple of notes do include Doc string comments to describe your program.
You can describe any classes that you write as well as any methods or functions, method and functions the same thing. You're free to design your solution in any fashion you wish. I don't care. I just want you to given this problem statement.
Here's what the input looks like. Here's what the output's supposed to look like. Can you write some python code to produce a proper output? I don't care how you do it. It doesn't need to be an object oriented solution. You don't need to write classes. You don't need to have instance fields. You could put your entire solution
in a main or just a single function. And then call it okay, I just want to see, do you have the basic syntax and problem solving skills to do this little minesweeper thing. And a second note unit testing is not required as part of the submission or the solution. You're going to do that in your team version of of this, you know, when you get together on teams. So so I'll have you do some unit testing then. So you get to put that together as a team. Okay? So
let's look at this minesweeper thing.
Okay, hopefully, like, I said, you've already read through this but we'll take a look.
Okay, I want lots of space. So while some of you will have done this and some of you won't. The old windows, operating systems like windows, 3.1 windows, 95, and so on. They all had this little game called Minesweep.
Okay, so you know, maybe you've never played it. It's not a huge deal so but but what it but what it says here, and zoom is in my way. So I have to move it.
And so, yeah, the way the game works, it says to help you. The game shows a number in a square which tells you how many minds there are adjacent to that square. For instance.
suppose the following 4 by 4 field with 2 mines, so the the mines are represented with asterisk or stars, and then safe spots are represented with dots or periods, if you want to call it that. So given this mining field here 4 by 4, so I just highlighted it. And there's 2 mines. Those are the stars.
If we would represent the same field placing the hint numbers described above, here's what it would look like. So the mines are always the minds. But then we replace the dots
with how many minds are adjacent to the dot.
Okay?
And so and so given this minefield.
Here's the result that you could call it the hint field if you wanted.
And so so yeah, each square can have at most 8 adjacent squares. And so what does it mean to be adjacent? Well, by looking at? I'm highlighting this number 2 here, or if I go up to the original that.is adjacent to 2 mines. So adjacent means
it's directly above, directly below, directly to the left, directly to the right, or diagonally above or below to the left and to the right
right. So that's what it means by a given square or location can have 8 adjacent squares.
So so yeah, that's why a couple of these guys have tubes, because
there's 2 different lines that are adjacent to it.
Okay, so and so what your job is going to be is given input with some stars and dots. Your output is going to be the hints you're going to replace the dots with hints. And the hints are just basically how many minds are adjacent to a given
location.
The mines always stay the same. And so now we're told what the input is guaranteed to look like it says the input will be an arbitrary number of mine fields. The 1st line of each field contains 2 integers.
column N. And M. And the fact is, the N. Is the number of rows, and the M is the number of columns, and what we're guaranteed is that N. And M
will be their integer values, and they'll be greater than 0.
And then no more than 100. So up to and including 100.
Okay? So yeah, the number of lines that's the N is the number of rows. And then the M is the number of columns.
Okay? And so the next N lines contain exactly M characters, and represent the field.
Each safe square is represented by a dot without the quotes. Each mine square is represented by an asterisk or star without the quotes.
And so then in your input file, the 1st field
line where both N and M are 0 represents the end of, input and very importantly, should not be processed.
Okay, and I'll skip down here. Okay, on on the second page you have sample. Input
and then here's the output that should be produced based on that. Input.
okay, so and so here's the output for each field.
You must print the following message in a line alone.
field number X, and then a colon where X. Stands for the number of the field. Starting from one.
the next N lines should contain the field with the dots replaced by a number of, or the number of adjacent lines to that square. There must be a single empty line between field outputs.
Another thing that's important to note is the F in field is capitalized. It is expected that you will do that.
Remember your output from your correctly running program needs to be the same as the official output posted on the assignment specifications, and we just took a look at it. I'll take a look at it again. And so here's a simple scenario where we have sample input to the program. So this would be in your input file.
Call it input txt there it is so. So we see a 4 space 4, and then a minefield. That's 4 by 4. Then we see 3 and 5. So 3 rows, 5 columns, and then we see that minefield. Then we see a 0 0 which says, done.
okay, so this is well formed data for your input, you're guaranteed. The input will be well formed, meaning the rows and columns will always be from one through 100. Of course, with the last, except for the scenario at the very end, where you'll see a 0 0. And that says, Stop
your output needs to start with field number, and then you start with one. And so the capital F matters. The space between the D and the number sign or pound sign there needs to be a space there. There needs to be a colon there. This needs to be on its own line. And then comes your hint. Field.
Okay, all the stars stay the same. But then the dots are replaced with a digit that says how many adjacent lines there are, and obviously that'll be anywhere from 0 to 8.
And then there's a blank line hard to see there. But there's a blank line between field Number one and field number 2. So so that's expected in terms of your output. So when we build software right? There's an expectation. The client, the customer wants things to look a certain way. You're like.
these are my, these are my rules. And so we're following that. And so we're paying attention to the details.
And so we're told, this is what the input looks like. And then this is what the outputs is going to look like so
and they're going to be the inputs in a file.
Let me go back to. I've got to move zoom again. It's in the way.
So so I gave you. Here's the official input.
right? And I said, Probably you don't want to run your solution on this right away, and what I did was I dropped. Oh, look! I dropped the original input from the sample problem we just looked at. There's the 4 4 and the 3 5.
Okay?
And then I have some edge cases. Okay, so this is important. When we build a software solution, we need to deal with edge cases so minimums and maximums. And so that's what we have here. Oh, look a 1 by one minefield that has a mine, a 1 by mine, one minefield that has a dot, and then I have 100 by 100, that's all mines.
and then a hundred by 100, that's all dots the wraparound here, or where is it at? Did I have wraparound? I guess it all displayed?
Okay, one by 100 and so on. And then ultimately some random stuff, 100 by 100 with who knows what? And then different numbers of rows and columns? Okay, so certainly, if your solution produces the correct output. So this is the input and so the official output.
Okay.
based on that, input, this is the output that should be produced. So you want your output from your program to exactly match this. And that's where you'll do the diff thing or go to one of those compare tools online.
Okay, so so that's your task.
and so so any questions
I'm going to talk about some strategies that you can use here. But but any questions
about what you're being asked to do. You're given input that looks like this stars and dots. And then your output. I mean, there's some formatting stuff. But your output stars will all be the same. But then the dots are replaced with digits
that that basically reflect for this location how many mines are adjacent to this sell, so to speak.
or location in the minefield. So the dots get replaced with digits
you've dealt with much worse in in in 501 and 502. This is just a quick sanity check. And like I said, I'm using it
for when you when you get in your teams. Then everybody gets to look at everybody else's solution. And and then you build a team solution.
So does does what you're being asked to do, make some sense.
And if it doesn't, please ask questions, and you can always email me if you're not sure but
any questions.
Okay, so let me talk about a little bit about some strategies.
Okay? And and, by the way, so we're we're at 3, 43 right now. I I'm probably gonna run a little bit extra.
Well, look at it this way. I mean, if you gotta go, you gotta go. And this stuff is recorded. But you're getting extra lecture from Tom at no extra tuition cost. How about that? I I just I just want to get material to you guys. You know. So so that so that you, you're getting a good product. And you're as prepared as possible moving forward. So okay, so there's the, there's the the specifications.
let's talk about
some strategy. Okay, remember, I don't care. You can write all your code and put it in main or a single function and just call that one function all right and deal with everything. Okay? And by the way, I'll look at the file input example and output example in just a sec. But let's strategize and talk about this.
some approaches to solving this problem.
So I have a little spreadsheet here.
Okay? And so what we have in the spreadsheet. This assumes the what's sitting on top.
Okay? It assumes this is a 4 by 4 minefield, right? And so hopefully you can see there's dots, and then there's stars those are the mines, and so
to me, probably your strategy. And and so I'm saying, probably you might see your solution differently. Okay, but
probably
you're going to want to have a nested loop, you know whether that's a for loop or whatever. But you're going to have a nested loop to walk through the entirety of this mining field, and you probably want to store this. You know, as you read stuff in from the file. You probably want to store it in a two-dimensional list.
So so so here's where I think
for your guys's last assignment in 5 0, 2.
You did the dungeon adventure. Is that right? Did you do the dungeon? Give me a thumbs up, or or did you? Or did. I thought I saw that. But maybe maybe I missed saw it.
What did you guys do in your last assignment? In 5 0, 2.
Yes, okay, so that that dungeon thing. So, and the reason I bring that up is probably you used.
And and this is part of why I have this problem here. Remember, I I built 502. So so probably you used a 2D list. And so you can refer back to. Well, I can't remember how to do. The 2D. 2 dimensional list, sometimes called a 2D. Array. All right. There lists in Python, but in in just computing in general and
computer science and stuff they're called arrays. So so you know the notion of rows and columns.
Anyways, you probably want a 2D array a 2D list and walk through the rows and columns. And the strategy is pretty simple, right? When you you know you start here at the beginning. You see a dot.
and you're like, Well, that's not a mine. So what I need to do is I need to look at all the adjacent cells.
all right, and count how many minds there are.
You know. And then ultimately, however many there are adjacent to it. Then you're gonna put a digit in there from from 0 to 8. That represents how many adjacent lines that's going to be part of your output. So so what you might have is.
you might have your your 2D list that has the minefield like we're looking at right here, I'll highlight it.
and then I'm not saying you have to do this, but you might decide. Oh.
I'm going to create another 2D list
that's going to be my results. And I'm going to put.
You know where the dots are. I'm going to put a digit from 0 to 8, depending on how many mines are adjacent to it, and of course, the mines. They're just going to stay mines right when we see a mine. It just stays mines.
But but you do have some issues right? Not not hard for you guys. I mean, you got through 5 0 1, the data structure stuff. But you know, one of the things here is if we have
at this location 0 0 in our list.
In general, we want to check for the surrounding 8 cells. But of course
there's there's nothing above 0 0, right? That would be like minus 1 0. So so you're out of bounds. Right? We could get an out of bounds problem and an exception could get raised by python.
So so you have to have a conditional statement, because because you want to check the previous row, which would be if you had. If you had a loop and you had a row variable and a column variable, you might want to say row minus one.
and in a like fashion, you might say. Whatever our current column is, you might want to say column minus one.
and that could be out of bounds.
And so you just have a conditional statement that says, Oh, you know, if if my row minus one is greater than or equal to 0, then it's okay to look at that spot. Same thing. If my column, minus one, is greater than or equal to 0, it's okay to look at that. So so you could do that that's totally fine
or poor.
So that's fine. You can go about that and write the code, and it'll work.
Or you could do this, my friends.
Okay, here's that same minefield. So it's highlighted here. It's supposed to be yellow. All right. Here's that original minefield. What if we made
what if we made our 2D list
and made it a little bigger.
Basically, here's how we could make it bigger. We could put an extra row above an extra row below
an extra column to the left and an extra column to the right.
You don't have to do this, but there's a really nice thing if you do that.
Okay. Now, remember, you're gonna read my little. Where's my little thing? Here?
Right? You're your input here all the way back to the top, 4 rows, 4 columns.
3 rows, 5 columns, one row, one column, 100 100. So you you know what's going to be. Input and so you could say, well, I want to set up. I want to set up my 2D list
to have 2 more rows and 2 more columns than whatever I read in so 6 rows and 6 columns, or 5 rows and 7 columns, all right. And then when you read stuff in.
you could have a loop that places the data here. And so there's a little overhead to do that.
But but maybe some of you already see what the advantage to. If I make a list that has this buffer around it.
The advantage is.
I'll start at 1 1 instead of 0 0, and when I look at the previous row
for the previous column.
I'm not outside the bounds of my 2D list right? I don't have to have a conditional statement that says, if rho minus one.
you know, is greater than or equal to 0. I don't care, because I know that everything will be inside the bounds, and all I'm doing is. Of course I'm going to check to see. Is there a star here? Is there a star here, or whatever? So so this is something that we can do. We sacrifice a little space
so that our code base is simpler. We don't have to have these conditional statements watching for out of bounds and worrying about an exception being raised. So you don't have to do that at all. But this is a possible strategy, and those that do programming contests and leak code. These are some things they do where they sacrifice a little space to simplify, maybe their overall code base, or to make things a little bit faster. So
when you guys did 5 0, 1
Did you talk about hashing, maybe, and and hash tables? Did did you talk about that notion a little bit. Was that was that a yeah, or it's like, no, we never talked about hashing.
Sean Warlick
Sean Warlick
02:09:41
Yeah, we talked about it.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
02:09:42
You talked about all right. And I was like, Okay.
so the thing about hashing and hash tables, right? This is a big old list. It's a big old array, and it sacrifices space for speed right with Hashing, you know. Maybe you talked about that. You don't want collisions.
and so you sacrifice space to avoid collisions. It's just like, if you're here in the Puget Sound area, you drive down. I 5 right? Your chances of a collision, you know, at 5 Pm. Are probably maybe higher than 5 am. Or 4 Am.
So less traffic, less chance of collision. But but anyways, you don't have to do this at all, but but it's just a little strategy you could use. And and so yeah, you're just nested for loop. You walk through. You look at a given cell. Okay, is it a dot? Now I need to check my surrounding cells and count up the stars. And then I just need to remember that maybe in a subsequent like, I said, 2D list 2D. Array that you write your information to, and then you print it out, and then you print it out. So
so so those are some things to consider in terms of solving this problem. And so now, what I want to do is I want to look at the code. Example.
That I have for you.
So this Pycharm file I/O, and so I have this open in good old pie. Charm.
What did I do here? Oh, I was monkeying around.
I have to open it again. Hold on recent projects.
New window.
Okay? So I have 2 different examples. They're they're kind of similar
And so there's this file, I/O example. And then there's file. Input. And I have a lot of
comments here. So let me see, in Pycharm alt shift.
Oh, plus
oh, oops!
There! I made it bigger than I intended.
Oh, shift there.
Okay, so
the the 1st once again zooms in my way. This example shows all right how to read.
We'll zoom zoom. Zoom.
Okay, there we go.
So read a number from a file that specifies how many lines of input follow.
Okay, you kind of have that on your minesweeper. You're gonna have a number of rows and then number of columns.
And then you're going to have a minefield. That's that many rows and columns.
Okay, but I didn't want to do exactly
the minesweeper. I wanted you to
do a little bit on your own. So
and so. Yeah, it says you can use that number to read a specific number of lines quite easily. And so I say, let's assume the input file has the following data.
all right. Not only that 0 says there are more, no more lines of data to read. So this is a variation of what you're going to do on your minesweeper.
All right?
So we see a 2. And then there's a couple of lines of data, and then there's a 3 and a couple or 3 lines of data, and then a 4, and then finally a 0.
Okay, so and so here's the code.
Alright, oh, the other thing I should point out, where's it at?
Okay? Oh,
well, actually, there, there doesn't need to be anything extra in terms of imports. So I just call this open function. And so here's the name of the file that I'm opening input 2 dot txt the R. Says I'm I'm reading from it.
I want to read from it. There. There's a w this one just wants to read. The next example shows you how to write to a file.
And so and so when I open that file.
Here's my input file. And so with that input file, I can call this read line function. And it does just that.
okay,
And so I can. I can point to it here, and good old pie charm will give me a little information. Okay, that says.
you know, we could go to the. We could go to the documentation if we wanted, but it'll read the current line. Okay, and it'll return it. Now the thing is is that read line reads the line and returns it. I know that what it contains in the example here, and this is why it's so important to know that your data is well formed. I know that what it has on that line is an integer.
Okay, so what I do is I cast it to an int. All right, and I'm pretty sure you guys are used to playing this game from from probably 501 and 502. But that's what's going on. And so I have this little variable called lines to read. And so I say, well, as long as lines to read isn't 0, then here's what I'm going to do. And so this is a proof of concept thing or a demonstration. So I just say, the current number of lines to read is, and I print it out, and then I use a little for loop. So for I and range of lines to read.
okay.
then, what I do is I from my input file, I do a read line all right. And I need to do this strip. Okay, because there's a backslash. N, that's sitting there that we have to strip off. It's just it's the backslash. N is the new line thing. And once again, not sure. And remembering everything you talked about in 501 and 502. So.
I get rid of that new line.
And I just put into this thing called data, which which is just a string. And and then I print it out.
Okay? And then, so that's what I do inside the loop.
Okay, that's going to grab. However, many line of data that followed. Once again, data is well formed. So this 2 says, there's 2 lines of data that follow. And then there's a 3 that says there's 3 more lines of data, and then the 4 says that there's 4. So this will handle that. And so after that for loop. I read in the next number.
Okay, I didn't put a comment there, but on line 30, I'm grabbing the next number, and that's inside my while loop, and it says, Well, as long as the number that I read in is not a 0, then I know I have stuff to read in
all right. And then finishing up, I just have this input file that close. And then I have a message that says, Okay, I'm done reading from the file.
Okay, so
and so with this file, input I think one of the things I can do is I can right click. I just right clicked on this. And I'm gonna say, run
okay, and cause I made everything giant hold on there.
So here's the output
current number of lines to read is 2 just read. Line one just read, line 2. Current number of lines to read is 3, and then I read, line one, line 2, 3, and then there was 4, and then I'm done reading from the file. So, you know, use this all right to help you. You're going to tweak this code.
but use this to to help get your input for your minesweeper.
And then there's the other example.
Okay? And this is filed file. I/O,
and I gotta move stuff around again.
Okay, so file I/O,
and so what this one does is this, one has the input as follows, there's 3 integers.
and then there's 2 strings.
Okay, and this 2 strings will occur one or more times, meaning
a pair of strings will be there all right.
and and that'll happen one or more times, and so 3 integers to start, and then, oh, here's some strings. Okay, 2 strings, one or more times. So Hello! Goodbye. Yes, no true, false, happy, happier.
alright! And so and so what I do 1st is, I open the file, read mode. So we just saw that in the previous example. So I call the open function
all right.
oh, and a quick note, if your file is in the same location as your source. And so this is what you guys should do for your minesweeper solution, then you only have to specify
the name of the file, not the location of where it is. So it is important to put your input file for testing and and running your solution, your minesweeper program. So that minestxt put it in the same folder. Okay? And so you're probably going to work in Picharm. Put it in the same folder, and then it'll find it if you for some reason. Put the input file somewhere else. Then you'd have to specify the path to where it's located in the file system. So don't do that. Keep it simple
and so then how do we open a file for output? We we say what name it is we want, and then, instead of an R, we do? A W,
okay.
and so yeah, there's a comment here, a couple of comments open for output. And so, by the way, to view the file in pie. Charm right? Click on your project folder, and then choose reload from disk. It'll refresh it
in case it doesn't appear, and then you can. Then you'll see the output dot txt, and you can double click and open it. And I I changed.
you know, output dot txt sitting here.
Okay, but
Here's the code. So anyways.
so that opens a file for output. And the thing to understand is that every time I run the program.
If I just do output and I do A. W. Whatever file was there before, it will override it. Okay, if the file doesn't exist, if the file doesn't exist. The output file doesn't exist the 1st time you run it it creates it for you.
Okay? And this is normal in almost all programming languages. This behavior that we see from python, I think, instead of A. W. If you wanted to keep what was there, I think you put an a there which is append. But but that's not something we're worried about for for this assignment.
And so then I grab the 1st line.
Okay? And so I do a read line and remember, read line returns that entire line, and it returns it as a string.
And so I already know, because the input was guaranteed. There are 3 integers. And so I do a 1st line. Dot split.
Okay. And I call it int. One and int 2 and int. 3. However, just because I call them integers doesn't make them integers. The split function returns strings. And so right here, just to show to check, to see what type it is. And hopefully you've seen the is instance before from 501, or probably 502 for error, checking with your setters and stuff. So here's this is instance. And so I say, is, is, int
is int one an int. Okay? And it'll tell me it's not. And so then I do a I do a typecast. So I make int one an actual int, and I sign it back into it because Python lets us do that
all right, and now I check. Oh, is is int one now an integer, and it will be. We'll run the program in a second, all right, and then I write out what the integers are.
and because I changed them to int when I try and do a concatenation operation right the plus with a string. You might remember this from 501 and 502. It wants to see strings get concatenated. So I have to turn int one back into a string. It doesn't truly change int one. It just takes a value that's there and says, Treat it as a string.
and then I show there's a couple of ways to read in those inputs those 2 lines.
And so I commented out the 1st way. And here's the second way. So I so I read the line, and and I do this while loop. And so when I say while line it just says, while there's actually something that gets assigned to this variable called line. I'm going to split it. And then I just print out what there was. Okay, I actually do 2 things. I write. I write
to the file what was just printed, and then I also echo it
to to the, to the screen.
Okay? And then you always want to make sure you close your files when you're done using them. Okay, that's just good general programming. I think the python interpreter will close them for us. But that's lazy to let that happen. So I formally close the files. So if we right click on this
and then choose, run.
Okay, did it run? Is it running?
Okay? Yes, it did. And so
from the 1st one is int. One and int, not at first, st because it's a string. Then I typecast it. And so it is. And then there was just that loop to read in the 2 strings, all right, and splits them so. Hello! Goodbye! Yes, no! True, false, happy, happier.
Okay, so this, this little couple of code examples in this Zip file show you how to do some basic file. I/O, in case, you didn't see much of that, or you just didn't remember it from either 501 or 502. So hopefully, you find that useful.
Okay.
take a look at this. If you haven't reach out to me as necessary. But what you'll need to do if you if you think about
what's going on with these examples?
You know, you're gonna read in
a rows and a columns right?
4 and a 4. And
that 1st number. I mean, you'll need to cast them to integers, because it's the rows and columns, and then you'll know that 1st number you read is the number of rows. So then you'll know how many lines to read, and so from there you should be able to populate your your 2D list, or I mean, there's ways you can just do a 1 d list if it's just a if it's just a list of strings. But then you'll need to walk through each of the
characters in the string. There's more than one way to solve the problem. Tom doesn't care how you solve it other than you solve it and not chat, gpt, or something like that. So
so there's the, there's the code example with file input output. That that should help you get to where you need to be to solve this little minesweeper problem. So we've gone past 4 o'clock. We're at 4 0, 5. I'm gonna I'm gonna try to start wrapping things up. But
from from what we just looked at, and I gotta move my zoom stuff again, were there any
like, wow! This
this file. I/O thing that's like, I just I don't get it. I mean, maybe you have to look at it and absorb it. Maybe you haven't had time to look at this stuff yet.
But any questions about this at 1st pass.
any concerns, something about what'd you do there, Tom? How come that worked? How come? I don't get it.
Weilan Liang
Weilan Liang
02:24:48
Oh, Tom, so
I basically strip the file by separating by into negative digits. So I was not sure about what's the number for? So I was just separate
the file by digits, so I'm not sure it will be a right way to do.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
02:25:08
I mean you can.
You can read the input in. However, you want willan
you can read it. However, you want these 2 examples.
You kind of combine them.
Like this example. Right here reads, let me scroll here.
I do a read line, okay, and
Weilan Liang
Weilan Liang
02:25:37
Yeah, yes, I was reading a file, and I read through a green line for each line. That's what happened.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
02:25:44
Yeah, I mean you. You can do that. Just remember that oops that read line returns a string.
You. You might need to change.
You might need.
Weilan Liang
Weilan Liang
02:25:56
Yeah, I I adding it back again. And that's what happens.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
02:25:59
Okay, it's like, yeah, split the string
to get the rows and columns.
and then then you can have a loop.
Weilan Liang
Weilan Liang
02:26:07
To read how many or or you could just.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
02:26:10
You could just say, It's this many you could read how many rows it is, and or split it. Read how many rows, and then read that many lines and just do a list of script. Yeah, I don't care how you do it.
Weilan Liang
Weilan Liang
02:26:21
Thank you.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
02:26:22
If you're solving the problem, I'm happy for you, and I'm happy for me.
and and I will. You guys like if you, if you want to meet with me over, Zoom, and you're not sure about this. You write some code on your own. I'll look at the code with you. We can walk through it. I can run the debugger with you if you want
but I'm happy to help you on this. If you're not sure what to do.
and especially because you haven't done file I/O before so, but it sounds like.
Weilan Liang
Weilan Liang
02:26:47
When I.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
02:26:47
That what you're doing is fine.
Weilan Liang
Weilan Liang
02:26:50
Can I meet you after class? Maybe.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
02:26:53
Sure. Yeah, you can. You can meet with me. You can. You can do a screen share and show me what you have in place. And yeah, we can talk about it.
Weilan Liang
Weilan Liang
02:27:03
Thank you.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
02:27:04
Absolutely. And that's the other thing I think I didn't get to on the syllabus. I do office hour right after class each day. And so that's true. Today, that'll be true pretty much every day.
And so so I'll start up my zoom, my office hour zoom, and then you can drop in.
So.
okay? And so, yeah, I would say, if you, if you've already written some code and you have some questions, then you probably want to meet with me, one on one, and and I'm glad to do that.
Okay, so so as we look at finishing up, let me go back to
our agenda and and look at what we did do and didn't do, and I know we wouldn't get through everything that's fine. We can pick up stuff next week, and I can always do little supplemental recordings during the week and post them for you. So
and so yeah, we went over the team info we talked about minesweeper and so we didn't get a chance to go over
this review stuff, which is pillars of oo solid probably haven't talked about solid but composition aggregation you've actually worked with that. You just might not remember those terms.
So so this is something that we'll go over next week, starting off. We'll also talk about the software lifecycle.
Okay, we'll also have a little brain teaser. So we'll go over the brain teaser. And I actually gave this very brain teaser to Google's AI called Gemini. And I want to talk about how Gemini solved the problem. And then I went back and forth with Gemini
asking it some questions, and it got some things wrong. And and so this is where I want you to see how these ais can get things wrong, and why it's why it's always going to be important for us to learn and know that whenever we use ais
that they'll get stuff wrong, and that that we need to know how to fix it. So so I'll show you that we did. Look at the file. I/O example, albeit briefly. Next week I will show you course, project examples from previous quarters. So you so you have a feel for for what's in front of you. But
and I mentioned there'll be a 3rd option.
So so we'll do those things to start next week. They'll be the team Group project, which I'll actually activate during the week. Once the teams are formed. I already mentioned what you're going to do as a team is come up with a team solution to the minesweeper.
and how you build it I don't care. It could be one person solution that they submitted individually. But there's there's some additional pieces that you'll do like you'll do some unit testing and some other stuff.
We'll talk about user stories. We'll talk about use cases. I'm going to introduce to you uml class diagrams, the syntax, and the basics of that. And then I also want to talk about a couple of design patterns. And I have code examples for strategy. You might have saw it in the 502. There's a robot thing that I built, so we'll review that and talk about why, it's important, and then we'll talk about model view controller.
and then time permitting different ways to build software I mentioned, there's agile. And then there's plan driven which has an engineering feel, so maybe maybe we'll talk a little bit about that with next Saturday's meeting. But these meetings that we have my friends are always
chock full of of information. We had to go through the busy work syllabus stuff, which is important. But but I'm gonna stop right now.
This is good enough for now. So any last questions or clarifications
before we call it a day in terms of our our Saturday lecture.
Sean Warlick
Sean Warlick
02:30:56
Thank you.
Tom Capaul
Tom Capaul
02:30:58
So so yeah, look for from me. Look for an announcement. Probably by Tuesday, with your team assignments. Make sure you get your team info in, and then I will also activate the team assignment which is to do the minesweeper stuff. Do some unit tests, add it to that, and then I'm going to have you do a little generator program
using AI, the the sample data that I gave you for the mine called Mindstxt. I'm going to have you use an AI to build you a little program? That'll that'll do the same thing. So I'll talk to you guys about that.
Okay, so we are finished. I'm going to take about 5 min to get a drink of water, and then I'm gonna start up my office hour. Zoom, okay. And so the link to that is on the homepage, on canvas. It's also on the syllabus.
and so please do drop by with any questions that you might have for me. I look forward to meeting with you other than that. Thank you for being here. Thanks for participating in the discussion. And I just I'm excited. I'm excited to work with you guys, so have yourself a great rest of the weekend. Get going on that minesweeper. If you haven't reach out to me if you need to, and have a great week, I'll see you next Saturday. Cheers.
